            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now fiue yeares ſince I publiſhed a booke called <hi>THE WAY TO THE TRVE CHVRCH,</hi> wherein my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was nothing elſe but onely to ſhew the weakeneſſe and inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of thoſe Motiues which leade ſo many to Papistrie, and to bring to triall ſuch reaſons as the Ieſuites and Seminaries ground themſelues vpon, in perſwading their people againſt vs: making it more then plaine that the corruptions of the Church of Rome are maintained, and the communion of our Church in the doctrine, preaching, and the Sacraments thereof, is refuſed, by ſuch as follow the Papacy, vpon weake and falſe grounds that cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. This poore booke, it ſeemes, hath not a little incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my Aduerſary, and diſcontented many that yet ſhould follow reaſon and the truth of things, and not be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with rumor and common impreſsion. For man being a noble creature, endued with reaſon, and faculty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and hauing a rule left him of God, whereby to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine things, ſhould not tie his faith and conſcience to the authority, or perſon of any, more then the truth and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and euidence of that be ſaies will beare him out. It was neuer heard of in the world, till now of late yeares, that the Pope and his definitions were the rule of faith, or that men were bound to follow whatſoeuer he ſhould appoint; but the
<pb facs="tcp:20570:13"/> Church of God, euery where, till tyranny oppreſſed it, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined his doctrine, accepting and allowing that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with the ſacred Scriptures, and the first antiquity, and reiecting the rest; and albeit many errors had long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, yet the godly ſtill held them to that rule of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: <hi>BVT FROM THE BEGINNING IT WAS NOT SO.</hi> Mat. <hi>19.8.</hi> Our Aduerſaries therefore may, in ſome points poſsible, pretend <hi>antiquitie;</hi> but <hi>PRIORITIE,</hi> which is the firſt and beſt antiquitie, they cannot in any one thing wherein they refuſe vs: and whether the zealous and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Recuſants will beleeue it or no, yet it is certainely true, there is no one point of Papiſtry Catholicke, that is to ſay, ſuch as hath bene from the beginning, generally receiued as an article of faith by the vniuerſall Church. And though it be granted that many parts of his religion haue long continued in the world, yet were they neuer the certaine or generall doctrines of the Church, but the corruptions of ſome therein, which, in time and by degrees, obtained that ſtrength and credit which now they haue: it being the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt thing of a thouſand for the Pope and his clergie ſitting at the ſterne, when themſelues had once imbraced them, with their ſtrength and learning to giue them authority in the world: when Mahomet himſelfe by policy and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie was able, in time, to ſpread abroad, and a vniuerſally, the doctrine of his Alchoran, which now is <hi>800</hi> yeare old, and is followed by many and great nations, as cloſe as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistrie is either in England or Italy. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Scripture makes it plaine, that <hi>FROM THE BEGINNING IT WAS NOT SO;</hi> and the Histories and monuments of antiquity, and the bookes of the elder Papists and ſuch as were chiefe in the Church of Rome, beare witneſſe that theſe things were miſliked, and in all ages complained of; and that
<pb facs="tcp:20570:13"/> which the Church of England now profeſſes was the faith of moſt godly men and holy Biſhops (though, the power of the gouernors in the Church of Rome increaſing, they were ſuppreſed) they do but deceiue themſelues that thinke our faith a new faith, or the points of Papiſtrie the old religion. I haue, as well as I haue bene able, and as diligently as I could, with an vnpartiall eie, and many teares to God, for his direction in the buſineſſe, and with a heart hating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and poſſeſſed as much as any mans liuing, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of peace and vnity: (whereof my <hi>17</hi> yeares reſidence in Lancaſhire can giue plentifull witneſſe) read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and trauelled through the writings of the Fathers, and obſerued the courſe of former times, and well aduiſed my ſelfe of that which the learned of the Church of Rome in later times haue written from the elder Schoolemen to the later Ieſuites; (though with all humility I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my ſelfe to be the meaneſt of any that haue taken this courſe; and much lament my owne weakneſſe) yet am I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, whenſoeuer God, the Iudge of all ſecrets, and the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reuenger of falſehood and partiality, ſhall call me foorth of this world, to teſtifie that my faith and religion and the points thereof maintained in my writings and preaching, is the truth; agreeable to the firſt antiquity; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, defended by the Ieſuites, and followed by Romiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants, error and vncatholicke. And if any perſons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to be learned, on the other ſide, haue either in their life or death, ſhewed extraordinary zeale for their Roman faith; I deſire I may be allowed my owne knowledge, both of ſome ſuch perſons and of their iudgement, and outward cariage: and not be importuned to follow that which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull and vnable, and partiall friends haue apprehended, rather then my owne cleare knowledge both of them and
<pb facs="tcp:20570:14"/> their cauſe. And if the Church of Rome haue in it diuers learned (betweene whom and vs, my Aduerſaries will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure no compariſon) that write againſt vs, yet my certaine experience of their manner of writing one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and against knowne antiquitie, and their ſtrange maintenance of the foulest and vnworthieſt things that are; and my knowledge of the meanes whereby, and the ends whereto, they are trained vp to this writing; and my daily exerciſe in their bookes, haue long ſince remooued from me all opinion of them; and taught me that learning, as beawty, can play the baude, and make them loue it that ſhall fall by it, and inamoured of it, that little know the danger of it. Let the ſeuerall points of their faith, which with that learning they maintaine, be well vnderſtood, and conſidered, (for the moſt vnderſtand them not) and let the manner of their proceeding in that they defend be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly looked into, and it will eaſily appeare that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and wit,
<note place="margin">Gen. 38.</note> like Thamar, hath prostituted her ſelfe, and ſits in the highway, and ſo ſhe may haue children, ſhe will deceiue Iudah her owne father. And when all learning, and the ripeſt wits, and holieſt Diuines the Church of Rome hath, are now wholly imploied in maintaining the Popes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ouer Princes, abſoluing ſubiects from their alleagiance, excuſing equiuocating, and the <hi>POWDER-TREASON;</hi> and making the actors Martyrs; and diſſoluing the very ioints and bands whereby the world, and Chriſtian ſociety, is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den together; it is high time to let the authoritie of mens perſons alone, and looke another while into the reaſons and cauſes they maintaine; and when they haue found the truth to ceaſe from contending, and labour by obedience and ſubmiſsion therunto to bring glory to God, that our tongues may profeſſe, and our liues glorifie his heauenly Maieſtie.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:20570:14"/>
            <p>Hauing therefore written, in my former booke to this effect, and plainely ſhewed all this and much more; that my countreymen, and the people of our nation, if they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, might ſee the triall of things: it is fallen out, that the Romiſh ſide findes it ſelfe, in an extraordinary manner; touched therewith: &amp; after many rumors, &amp; vowes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute me, at laſt, about <hi>18.</hi> monethes ſince, I receaued this Reply which here thou ſeeſt. And, although I take no pleaſure in contentious writings, but (as time ſhall ſhew, if I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue my courſe and God giue meanes) intend that which ſhall cleare the controuerſies without contention; yet when I had heard many reports of ſomething that would be done, with effect, against me, I was willing to giue ſatisfaction againe, least the ignorant might be perſwaded ſomething was writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> indeed that could not be anſwered. It is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely but others alſo (for they haue more helps, meanes, and leaſure then I haue) as ſoone as they can be furniſhed, wil be doing: &amp; more may yet be written: for ſo he ſends me word that writ the laſt Triumph of Purgatory (an Author that ſure will ouerthrow the Chariot and lay all in the mire if he be ſet to driue it) and ſo I haue bene often told, and ſent word: and therefore if any ſhall chance to write in forme and without paſsion (whereof this man is full) and with modeſty will ſay what he thinks, ſpeaking directly and home to that I haue ſaid, without declining or ſhrinking from the point that preſſes him, that I may finde him an honeſt minded man, and not a Mercurialiſt; I will gratifie him againe, with the ſame that he brings; and freely reuoke and confeſſe any error that he ſhall ſhew to haue eſcaped me. If I be otherwiſe dealt with that nothing be ſought but the diſgrace of my perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; vndirect diſcrediting of my booke; it is likely that I ſhall take my reſolution from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
<pb facs="tcp:20570:15"/> of my aduerſary when I ſee him, and do as his booke against me ſhall deſerue. In the meane time, be admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of <hi>4.</hi> things touching this Reply and my owne Defence. Firſt, that whereas he hath in the ſame booke, written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt M. wootton, a learned Diuine, as well as me; I med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle onely with that which concernes my ſelfe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, taking his booke before me, I anſwer onely the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that are againſt me. Next, all that I meddle with is ſet downe <hi>verbatim</hi> as it lies; and the number of his page in the margent ouer againſt his text. Then I haue in this ſort gone through his whole booke, til within a little of the end; which containing no new matter, but the ſame that I had occaſion to anſwer diuers times afore, I would loſe no time about it. Fourthly, I haue anſwered fully and directly to euery word he ſaieth: by which diligence, I haue benefited the Reader ſo much, that howſoeuer my Aduerſary may ſeeme meane, and vnworthy confuting, yet he ſhall not loſe his labour in reading, but finde my paines bestowed profitably vpon him ſuch as he is: who yet (to giue him his due, though he raile hard and vnciuilly, and write an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and vnpleaſing stile) hath replied with all the best and ſutableſt arguments he could finde in Stapleton, Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and Valentia; touching the points depending, and onely failes in replying to that which I had anſwered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Hereafter let me intreate the good and courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if he will vouchſafe to vſe my writings, not to iudge of them but by his owne triall and examination. For they haue ſecretly to their wel-willers, laid imputations vpon them, who being ſurpriſed with conceit are afraid to make the triall or to meete the truth. The quotations, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or Authors alledged may be challenged, &amp; reported to
<pb facs="tcp:20570:15"/> be falſe: yet this Reply hath charged but onely one in all his booke: and they which haue bene lowdeſt and earneſteſt, may finde in ſuch a multitude poſsible ſome, to proue that the diligenteſt writer may be ouerſeene: but the ſubſtance they cannot diſcredit. If I haue erred in any thing, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken an Author, I acknowledge my ſelfe to be a man that may erre; and I humbly ſubmit what I haue done, not onely to the Church wherein I liue, but to euery moderate and peaceable minded man therein: yea I will, with all reſpect of his perſon, heare, and aduiſe of, any thing that an <hi>aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> ſhall informe me of, if he will hold the rules of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an truth and charity; and go forward with me in that courſe to ſeeke the truth: which all men ſee euermore to be lost where words and wrangling giue the ſound. And I intreate, euen thoſe that cleaue moſt to the Church of Rome, to perſwade themſelues that whatſoeuer I haue written is for their ſakes, that if it were poſsible they might diſcerne the truth offered them, and the wickedneſſe of the Ieſuites that leade them. I maligne no mans perſon, I hate none that is among them; but being called to be a Preacher of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, I am deſirous to bestow my ſpare houres in maintenance of that I preach: and for the which I were ready to ſacrifice my life, much more to bestow my time and trauell; that if it might ſo pleaſe God, we might be all as one; and the state and gouernement wherein we liue, be no longer toſſed and intangled with our diſagreements. They cannot but ſee that God, by eſtabliſhing the Kings throne, and bleſsing it againſt the malice &amp; vnnatural practiſes of their Church, giues teſtimony on our ſide, and checks the Pope and all his counſels, thereby to inuite them to peace and vnity: they know that we inuocate one God, and beleeue all the articles of the Creed and rule of faith, and preach and preſſe godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:20570:16"/> of life without partiality, puniſhing ſinne and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding well doing, as much as can be done in any kingdome or ſtate that themſelues allow: they haue ſeene, within the memory of man, innumerable ſoules giuing their life for the testimony of that we beleeue: onely we differ in diuers articles, which potent and skilfull aduerſaries, at ſeuerall times, in ages paſt, brought into the Church: let our writings be vnpartially weighed, and the Scriptures be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently read, and the firſt Antiquity well conſidered, and it will appeare they are in an error, and kept in bondage thereto, onely through the ſubtilty and cunning of their maſſe Prieſts. God of his goodneſſe open their eyes and eares that they may embrace the truth and come forth of Babylon, and, ſhaking off their ſuperſtition, content themſelues with the Teſtament of Ieſus Chriſt, to whom be all honour and power aſcribed for euer. Amen. <hi>xij. Maij 1614.</hi>

The Commendation that he giues his <hi>Method,</hi> may not be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for we allow Apes to hugge their yong ones, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes to conceit their owne deuices; and I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, it is good round <hi>Method</hi> indeed for the purpoſe, and <hi>profitable,</hi> for them, to be followed. For if you will ſee it, this it is: <hi>Good Eue for your ſoules health,</hi> I were readie to ſhed my beſt bloud: <hi>and therefore haue ventured my life, as you ſee, (vpon the entertainment you know of, ſuch as I find in the hiding roomes) to bring you home to the Catholicke Church, your Method is this: Cloſe vp your eies, and examine nothing, but obſtinately renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Proteſtants, and ſtopping your eares againſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in all things beleeue vs, who</hi> on my owne word <hi>are the Church of God; and ſubmitting your ſelfe to the direction of your ghoſtly father, without more adoe be reſolute, and you ſhall eaſily be perſwaded of our Roman faith.</hi> This is a good ſure <hi>Method</hi> to reſolution, and makes many <hi>reſolute,</hi> indeed: and the Ieſuite hauing found by experience how kindly it works with good natures, had reaſon to commend it; though in any indifferent iudgement, it be a poore one, as will appeare. The reſt of his <hi>Preface</hi> is traſh: come we to that which is materiall.</p>
               <p n="7">7 After the Preface, to ſhew my <hi>vnſincere dealing,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he complaines, he makes a title of <hi>examples of groſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, gathered out of M Woottons, and M. Whites bookes; by which the diſcreete reader may ſee how little ſinceritie or care of truth they haue had: and conſequently, how little credit is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to their writings:</hi> and hauing diſpatched M. Wootton, he comes to me with theſe words: <hi>Now to come to M. White, whoſe booke is ſaid to do much more harme among the ſimple, then M. Woottons doth; I hope I ſhall lay open ſuch foule want of ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20570:26"/> and care of truth in him, as it will plainly appeare, that thoſe which ſhall hereafter take harme by giuing credence to his words or writings, ſhall ſhew themſeluis to be very ſimple indeed.</hi> So that, in all probabilie, he ſhould haue ſome great matter to ſhew, that makes ſo large an offer; and yet euery one of theſe <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi> will proue in the ſcanning, ſo many <hi>teſtimonies</hi> of his owne weakneſſe and immodeſty: when hauing had the book foure yeares in his hands, and ſo many of his conſorts to ioyne with him in replying, (all which time their rage againſt it, and deſire to diſcredit it, and vowes to confute it, appeared well enough) yet now at the laſt can obiect no other <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of vntruth, then theſe. And that we may know he comes furniſhed, he cals for a railing roome to brawle in.

Now may any Papiſt warrant his religion from the imputation? and what ſecuritie can he giue to the State? what pawne to his Soueraigne for his loyaltie? that the King and his State may be certen he will neuer practiſe or ſtirre againſt them.

And if it be obiected, that other Papiſts write otherwiſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute him, I care not for that: for they write at this day one againſt another, in euery point of their faith, and agree in nothing: in the queſtions of <hi>Predeſtination: the concourſe of Gods helpe with inferiour cauſes: Praedeterminations: the Popes primacie: taking the oath of allegiance: worſhip of Images: Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will: Tranſubſtantiation: Antichriſt: Latin ſeruice:</hi> and yet all the Ieſuites liuing cannot proue <hi>this</hi> to be their Churches doctrine rather then <hi>that.</hi> And therefore as touching his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries that deale againſt him, Baius his opinion may be the Trent opinion, as well as theirs: nay better: for he was there preſent, when the doctrine of merits was concluded and agreed vpon, and his booke alledges the Councell on his ſide.</p>

               <p n="4">4 Thus I haue ſhewed that Baius in his words by me quoted, teaches no other doctrine then is ordinarily taught by other Diuines in the Church; and the Ieſuites arguments to the contrary, are eaſily anſwered.

                  </note> Baius denies not; but yet for all that, holding that workes ſo done, haue in them an <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall righteouſneſſe,</hi> and worthineſſe of <hi>their owne;</hi> they muſt needs hold conſequently, that God in iuſtice is bound to reward them, in the ſame maner that he rewards Angels, or would haue rewarded Adam if he had neuer fallen, which
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20570:46"/> was by the couenant of workes. And it ſhould ſeeme the Ieſuite by his manner of citing them, ſaw not the bookes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, but borowed the quotations of his friends.

                  <p n="4">4 This is his reaſon why the Church of Rome denies the Scripture to be the <hi>whole</hi> rule of faith: for the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding whereof, haue your eye vpon my words. I ſaid, that <hi>one of their practiſes againſt the Scripture, is their depriuing it from being the totall rule of faith:</hi> and I added, that <hi>hereby they left themſelues vtterly voide of all meanes to ſecure their faith by, and to finde the truth: inaſmuch as the Church, the Fathers, the Councels, the Pope himſelfe, which is all the rule they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, are ſubiect to error, and ſo by themſelues confeſſed to be.</hi> To this he replies three things: firſt that they <hi>hold the Scripture to be one rule, yea a principall rule of our faith, which they would not do, if they were enemies to the Scripture.</hi> I anſwer diſtinctly three things: firſt, ſometime ſome of them, when they are preſſed, &amp; cannot ſhift the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, ſay as the Ieſuit here doth, <hi>the Scripture is the rule,</hi> and <hi>the principall rule too;</hi> yea more, ſo <hi>Bellar.

Secondly, howſoeuer ſome of them ſometime ſpeake thus, yet againe others allow it to be but <hi>a part</hi> of the rule: that is to ſay, ſuch as containes but one part of things belonging to faith. Thus you ſee the Ieſuit expounds himſelfe in his next words: <hi>we hold ſomething elſe beſide Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be with Scripture the rule of faith.</hi> Becan
<note n="f" place="margin">Circ. Caluin. pag 278.</note> ſayes, <hi>The totall and full rule of our faith, is Scripture and Tradition both together:</hi> and this is defined in

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20570:56"/> when thus they accuſe it of imperfection, and match baſe and vncertaine traditions with it. Therefore vntill they can proue, firſt that this <hi>defect</hi> is in the Scripture: next, that this defect is ſupplied by <hi>Traditions;</hi> and then thirdly that <hi>theſe</hi> whereof they boaſt, are the true Traditions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the ſame Spirit, that the Scripture doth, and left of God to ſupply this defect of the Scripture, they can neuer ſhake off the imputation layed vpon them, that they be <hi>enemies to the Scripture.</hi> Thirdly, they do not hold the Scripture to be a <hi>principall</hi> rule, neither as the Ieſuite ſpeakes. Would they did for their owne ſakes: but the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite knowes it is holden to be the leaſt part of the rule. The Biſhops of the Councell of Baſil

                  <q>A. D. The ſixt marke (ſaith M. White) is that prodigious igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, whereunto they fall, who liue in papiſtry,
<note place="margin">Pag. 35.</note> for proofe whereof he ſetteth downe certaine examples which he ſaith, he hath obſerued from the common people, to wit, theſe inſuing: <hi>Creezum zuum pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum onitentem, &amp;c. Little Creed &amp;c White pater noſter &amp;c.</hi> After which hauing two other examples of like odde ſtuffe, he further ſaith, <hi>Their prayers, and traditions of this ſort are infinite, and the ceremonies they vſe in all their actions, are nothing inferiour to the Gentiles in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ſtrangenes, which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>any man may eaſily obſerue, that conuerſeth with them, &amp;c. And it cannot be anſwered</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that theſe are the cuſtomes of a few ſimple people: for this which I ſay is generall through the countrey, the whole body of the common people, Popiſhly addicted, practiſing nothing elſe vntill it pleaſe God by the Miniſtry of the Goſpell to conuert them, yea the moſt men, and women deuoted to Papiſtrie, though well borne, and brought vp for ciuill qualities, and of good place in the countrey, yet lie plunged in this ignorance.</hi> This is the Miniſters lying relation, which I thought fit to recite ſomething at large, as being ſuch, and ſo groſſe of it ſelfe, as it will without any thing ſaid by me, ſufficiently diſcredit it ſelfe. And I maruell with what face, he that in his laſt <hi>Marke,</hi> hath ſo ſoberly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched againſt <hi>intemperate, and vnchriſtian proceeding, groſſe lying, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:20570:68"/> railing, &amp;c:</hi> can now come, &amp; ſit as it were on an Ale-bench, and relate ſuch notorious, ridiculous, and ſlanderous vntruthes. Vnto which firſt I ſay, that notwithſtanding all the conuerſation I haue had this many yeares, with <hi>Catholicks</hi> of diuers ſorts, rich, and poore, old, and yong, learned, and vnlearned, in the South, and in the North, I may proteſt, that vntill I read them in M. Whites booke, I neuer heard of any one of theſe examples to be vſed by any Catholike, nor indeed did I euer before here of any one of theſe abſurd formes of prayer to be ſo much as extant in the world. Secondly I ſay, that diuerſe Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, of far better credit, then M. White (liuing in that very coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, where M. White liueth, and hauing farre more inward conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with Catholikes which liue thereabouts, then he is like to haue) haue bene demanded, what their knowledge was about this point, and no one of them did know, any Catholike man, or woman, that did vſe to ſay their prayers in ſuch a ridiculous ſort. But admit the Miniſter had met at the <hi>Ale-houſe,</hi> ſome <hi>drunken old man,</hi> or ſome <hi>doting old wife,</hi> of whom he might perchance receiue this ridiculous rotten ſtuffe, to ſay nothing, of what better knowledge of the neceſſary points of Faith, ſuch perſons in their better wit, and ſenſe, might haue, I aske M. White, whether he thinke that theſe few examples be ſufficient to iuſtifie this generall aſſertion, wherein he ſaith, <hi>their praiers, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of this ſort are infinite,</hi> and the <hi>ceremonies they vſe in all their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions nothing inferiour to the Gentiles</hi> in number, and ſtrangenes. What? Haue we infinite <hi>prayers,</hi> and <hi>traditions</hi> like the <hi>white pater noſter, little creed, &amp;c?</hi> Do we vſe alſo <hi>ceremonies,</hi> not onely in ſome, but abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in all our actions? And are theſe <hi>ceremonies</hi> nothing, not a iot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the Gentiles, in <hi>number,</hi> and <hi>ſtrangenes?</hi> Surely this is ſtrange, and ſo ſtrange, that he were a ſtrange man who would beleeue it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially hauing neuer ſeene, nor obſerued any ſuch matter: but what man is there, who although he liued neuer ſo long in company of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, did, or could ſee, or obſerue, any ſuch matter? yet M. White (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) will needs perſwade vs, that <hi>any man that conuerſeth with Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes may eaſily obſerue it.</hi> Well, let vs go forwarward, and beleeue (if we can) that M. White with Lynceus eies hath ſeene, or obſerued, that which no other perſon, nor we our ſelues haue ſeene, nor poſſibly can ſee, and obſerue. At leaſt good M. White, giue us leaue to anſwer, that if you haue ſeene, and obſerued ſome ſuch matter, yet it is not in <hi>all</hi> of vs, nor in the <hi>moſt</hi> of vs, nor in <hi>many,</hi> eſpecially of eminent <hi>qualitie,</hi> or note among vs: but at the moſt in ſome <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>few</hi> ſimple people, whoſe ignorance to attribute to vs generally, or indefinitely, would ſmell rankely of brutiſh ignorance, or aboundant malice. Nay (ſaith M. White) <hi>it cannot be anſwered, that theſe are the customes of a few ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people: for this that I ſay, is generall throughout the countrie, the whole body of the people Popiſhly addicted, practiſing nothing elſe, vntill it pleaſe God by the miniſtrie of the Goſpell to conuert them: yea the moſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:20570:68"/> men, and women, deuoted to Papiſtrie, though well borne, and brought vp for ciuill qualities, and of good place in the countrie, yet lie plunged in this ignorance.</hi> And ſay you ſo Sir Miniſter indeed? Do you ſay, that theſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms be <hi>generall</hi> throughout the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try? Do you alſo ſay, that the <hi>whole body</hi> of the common people popiſhly addicted do practiſe nothing elſe but <hi>Creezum zuum, little creed, white pater noster, &amp;c:</hi> And this (not for ſome ſhort while, till themſelues by their owne wit, or ſome other of the wiſer ſort of Catholickes, perceiue, and correct this fooliſh cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, but abſolutely all the while they continue Catholikes) vntill (which ſeldome happeneth to ſound Catholikes) they be <hi>conuerted</hi> (or rather peruerted) by the Proteſtant Miniſtry? Do you alſo ſay, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>the whole bodie of the common people,</hi> yea euen the <hi>moſt men, and women deuoted to Papistrie,</hi> though <hi>well borne, and brought up for ciuill qualities, and of good place in the countrie,</hi> yet lie plunged in this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? Do you, Sir Miniſter, ſay all this? Surely if you ſay it, and will ſtand to it, you deſerue the whetſtone. For if this be not a groſſe lie, I know not what is. If you haue a face to affirme this, worthily may your countrymen wonder, and ſay (as a perſon of good eſteeme, and place in that your country hath affirmed, that many of your countrimen hauing read this part of your booke haue wondered, and ſaid) <hi>What truth may we thinke can be expected in the proceſſe of this mans booke, whileſt he citeth Authors, which few haue meanes ſufficiently to examine, or when he telleth of things done in former times, or forraigne countries, when we finde him ſo ſhameleſſe, and impudently falſe in relating home matters, ſo contrary to our certaine,</hi> and direct <hi>knowledge?</hi>

Now when the word round about ſees theſe things, muſt we alone hold our peace? my head is broken on euery ſide, and when the blood guſhes out round about, ſhall I thinke to hide it? Whatſoever I put about it will be bloodied; and my ſhame will be the greater, thus to go about to hide, that which will not be hidden.</hi> This is it that I ſay for my ſelfe againſt the Ieſuites reproches: come we now to his Reply.

Next he mocks vs againe, in that he ſayes he <hi>neuer heard any</hi> of <hi>theſe formes:</hi> for no doubt he hath heard, as bad as <hi>theſe</hi> in other words, if he haue not heard theſe: and I make no queſtion but ſome of thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, that haue bene <hi>demanded their knowledge about this point;</hi> if they were ouerheard, when they ſay their prayers, would ſpeake no better.

And here it is not enough to bring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectures, and with ſhew of wordes, and diſputations, to leade our iudgement, as in this cauſe our aduerſaries haue taken great paines to pull vpon themſelves a learned error: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can pray in this faſhion to the dead with faith; if all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther difficulties were cleared, I muſt haue a ſure ground in my conſcience, that they heare me. And he that will perſwade me to beleeue they do, muſt not come with Iffs, and Ands, and Metaphyſicall ſpeculations, and the ſeeming opinions of men: but with that which may bring full aſſurance, and may ſupport faith, as the Holy Ghoſt doth.

For by the <hi>circumſtance</hi> of our inward meaning, commonly knowne, both by our ordinary practiſe, and publicke doctrine, it is euident that we do not, by theſe names, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and formes of ſpeech, attribute to Saint Francis, or our bleſſed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, or to any Saint, the ſame ſeruice or worſhip, which we giue to our Sauiour, but in a farre inferiour reſpect, more or leſſe, according to the more or leſſe inward eſtimation which we haue of their ſanctitie, dignitie and merit, which we alwayes conceiue to be inferiour to, and depending of the ſanctitie, dignitie and merit of our Sauiour Chriſt. Which anſwer if M.

For although outward words and actions be the ſignes by which we outwardly yeeld honour and worſhip: yet the chiefe thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in honour and worſhip do conſiſt, is the inward eſtimation and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence thereupon enſuing, from which theſe outward ſignes proceed: which inward eſtimation and reuerence being wanting, outward ſignes be meere mockeries, and not true honour and worſhip; and the inward eſtimation and reuerence being preſent, maketh thoſe ſignes to haue in them the nature of true honour and worſhip, in ſuch difference of degrees, as the inward eſtimation and reuerence ſhall be different, as it may be, and is ordinarily very different, euen when the outward words and actions, by which we expreſſe it, are the very ſame in ſubſtance or ſimilitude. As for example, we honour God when we kneele to him, and call him <hi>Father,</hi> and we honour our earthly parent by kneeling in like manner vnto him, and calling him <hi>Father:</hi> here
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20570:80"/> the words and outward actions are altogether alike, yet becauſe the inward eſtimation and reuerence which we haue towards God, and which we haue towards an earthly parent, euen in this action of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and in calling them by the ſame name <hi>Father,</hi> are farre different.

The reaſon is, becauſe the commandement &amp; doctrine
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:20570:82"/> of the Scripture, ties vs to God alone; which being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed, there is the reall and <hi>formall</hi> reaſon of ſuperſtition, whatſoeuer the opinion and intent of the minde be.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 But the Ieſuite replies, that <hi>like as we kneele to God, and call him our Father, ſo do we the ſame things to our earthly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and yet the honour we giue them hereby, is farre different from that we yeeld to God: therefore we may vſe the ſame inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and words to the Saints, that we doe to God, when the minde acknowledges not that excellencie in them, that it doth in him; as children vſe the ſame kneeling and words to their fathers, they do to God.</hi> I anſwer two things: firſt, granting that <hi>words</hi> and outward <hi>geſtures</hi> are qualified and conditioned by the <hi>meaning</hi> of him that vſes them, as he that called the Prophet,
<note n="h" place="margin">2. Reg. 2.12. &amp; 13.14.</note> 
                     <hi>my Father, my Father,</hi> meant not that <hi>hie degree of Honor,</hi> that he did when he called God his <hi>Father:</hi> and therefore I will not deny, but Papiſts, vſing theſe inuocations mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Saints, <hi>may</hi> meane them otherwiſe then they do to God, as for example calling the virgin Mary their <hi>Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,</hi> their <hi>Hope,</hi> their <hi>Sauiour,</hi> they may meane ſhe is ſo, not <hi>of her ſelfe,</hi> but <hi>vnder Chriſt,</hi> and not <hi>principally</hi> by her owne merits, but <hi>ſubordinarily</hi> by the merits, and grace of her Sonne. This I will eaſily grant, <hi>may</hi> be the meaning of their wordes: but then I anſwer ſecondly, that it doth not follow, that therefore we may, with ſuch reſeruation of our meaning, in the ſame wordes inuocate, and worſhip the Saints departed: firſt becauſe the ſaid inuocation is diuine honour, from what minde ſoeuer it proceed; whether the Saint be called vpon as the ſupreme and eternal beginning, or whether onely as the friend of God, that by reaſon of his nearneſſe to him, can ſooner intreate him then my ſelfe. If he be inuocated with the titles of <hi>Aduocate, Sauiour, Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi> though the intent be but onely to vſe him as a friend to intreate, yet this is diuine honour, belonging to Ieſus Chriſt. For all prayer is diuine honour, and ſuch titles as are giuen them in their worſhip, <hi>(Mediator, Hope, Aduocate, Confidence, Sauiour, Redeemer, Ladie, Queene of heauen, &amp;c.)</hi> exceed the meaſure of all ciuill reuerence and adoration
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:20570:82"/> whatſoeuer, and therefore are not like the calling of our earthly parent <hi>father,</hi> or <hi>kneeling</hi> to him. Secondly the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of a creature, is idolatrie, though he that worſhip it acknowledge it to be but a creature, &amp; ſubordinate to God a thouſand times: becauſe the commandement is,
<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 4.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely thou ſhalt ſerue.</hi> When the diuell tempted our Sauiour to fall downe before him, he did not require him to perſwade himſelfe that he was <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houah,</hi> or that he had thoſe things <hi>of himſelfe;</hi> for he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto him,
<note n="k" place="margin">Luc. 4.6.</note> 
                     <hi>he had receiued them:</hi> but onely that he would <hi>kneele</hi> vnto him, and accept thoſe things at his hands. And our Sauiour refuſed it, not onely becauſe he was the diuell, but alſo becauſe the commandement forbids the giuing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine honour to a creature, with any opinion, <hi>eſtimation,</hi> or iudgement whatſoeuer.
<note n="l" place="margin">Apoc. 19.10. &amp; 22.8.</note> When S.

Luther is dead: therefore Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall riſe. Euery one that begets, really differs from him that is begotten: the Father begets the Sonne: therefore the Father really differs from the Sonne. Here both the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are ſuch verities as belongs to faith. For Luther belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he ſhould riſe; and all we beleeue the Father really dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the Sonne: yet neither of them are expreſly reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or written in the Scripture (as it is not, that Luther, or White ſhall be ſaued, or haue their ſinnes pardoned) but the Minor propoſition in the firſt diſcourſe, and the Maior in the ſecond, are knowne otherwiſe, and by good connexion ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to that which is written; and therefore the concluſion is beleeued by faith.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion belongs to faith: but the aſſurance of the remiſſion of a mans owne ſinnes, is a theologicall concluſion: therefore it belongs to faith.</hi> The firſt propoſition is manifeſt. The ſecond is prooued thus. <hi>All that are penitent, and beleeue, haue the remiſſion of ſinnes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them:</hi> the which propoſition is of faith: becauſe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly reuealed, Eſay the 1.16.17.18. Act. 3.19. Rom. 10.9. Ezek. 18.21. <hi>But I repent, and beleeue;</hi> this propoſition is euident, and certaine to him that doth ſo.

For there are many propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of faith, which cannot otherwiſe be prooued to be of faith, but becauſe they do euidently follow of thoſe things that are beleeued, at leaſt with ſome propoſition euident according to naturall light.</hi> And indeede how many propoſitions of faith are there, that cannot be ſhewed ſo to be,

               <p n="1">1 OVr doctrine is, that in the things reuealed in the Scripture, and belonging to the obiect of faith, there is a difference; whereby ſome are more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be knowne, and without error to be vnderſtood, then otherſome. For though it be lawfull for no man either to <hi>misbeleeue,</hi> or <hi>obſtinately not to beleeue</hi> any thing that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet the <hi>ſimple</hi> ignorance, or error, in many things, hinders not ſaluation, nor the ſubſtance of Faith: but either a priuate man, or a whole particular Church thus <hi>ignorant,</hi> or <hi>erring</hi> (either inuincibly, or not affectedly, and obſtinately) in ſuch things, and yet holding others aright, hath ſauing faith, and is in the ſtate of grace. This difference of things ariſes from 3. reſpects. Firſt, of <hi>the commandement</hi> enioyning, and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the knowledge of one thing, more then the knowledge of another: as for example, the knowledge of Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, more then the knowledge of his Genealogy: for though both be reuealed <hi>alike,</hi> yet not both <hi>vnder</hi> the like penalty. Secondly, of <hi>the nature,</hi> and condition of the things; when this doth more properly, and neceſſarilie belong to ſaluation, then that: for without the knowledge of ſtory of Gedeon, I may be ſaued: but without the knowledge of Chriſts nature, and office I cannot. Thirdly, of their <hi>vſe.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one thing is the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ground, that giues light, and ſubſiſtence, to another; as the knowledge of Chriſts office, &amp; merits brings light to the vnderſtanding of the doctrine, touching our owne vnworthineſſe: &amp;c. Out of theſe reſpects, and degrees of things, that are beleeued, as they ſtand in order one to another, and in vſe to vs, we call ſome FVN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAMENTALL, and ſome NOT FVNDAMENTALL; not with relation to our faith ſo much as to our knowledge; in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:20570:95"/> as much, as it is da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous to miſdoubt the truth of any thing, that is reuealed to us, if it were but:
<note n="a" place="margin">2. Sam. 24.9. 1.

Forſomuch as ſuch a point is reuealed, but for the manifeſtation of the other, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued but in order to the other: as, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſo many children, <hi>Paul</hi> had a cloke: The dead pray for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, &amp;c: wherein it may fall out, that we may erre or be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and yet the faith not preiudiced.</p>

               <p n="3">3 This diſtinction, by
<note n="g" place="margin">THE WAY pag. 110.</note> me onely touched, and that by the way, briefly, vpon another occaſion, the Ieſuite in this chapter frowardly cauils at: and in this place wrangles with the definition that I gaue of points <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>not found in the words of the Scripture,</hi> that I cited, for it, <hi>in the margent.</hi> Whereto I anſwer three things. Firſt,
<note n="h" place="margin">Act. 4.12. 1. Cor. 3.11. Eph. 2.19.</note> the Scriptures cited ſhew the knowledge, &amp; expreſſe faith of Chriſts death, to be <hi>abſolutely</hi> neceſſary for <hi>all</hi> men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and two of the places call the matter of this knowledge a <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</hi> Therefore ſuch a point as is abſolutely to be knowne, and rightly holden of all (which euery point reuealed is not) may be called a <hi>Foundation,</hi> or <hi>Fundamentall</hi> point: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore againe, ſuch as, by the like confeſſion of our aduerſaries, ſome men, and all men of ſome times, may erre in, or be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, without preiudice of Saluation, may be called a point <hi>not Fundamentall:</hi> whence it followes againe, that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:20570:96"/> my diſtinction is grounded well enough vpon the places ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the margent. Secondly, I anſwer, that how ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſoeuer Ieſuites thinke of the Scripture, yet we Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants had as lieffe borrow our concluſions, diſtinctions, and words, wherein we expreſſe them, from it; as from the ſtinking puddles of rotten Schoolemen, or new found mint of vpſtart Ieſuites. Thirdly, my aduerſary himſelfe, in this very chapter, acknowledges the diſtinction, <hi>if it bee not applyed to a wrong end,</hi> to be <hi>good.</hi> For firſt touching the termes thereof, <hi>Fundamentall, not Fundamentall:</hi> He finds the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in S. Auſtin. <hi>True it is, S. Auſtin inſinuates a diſtinction of ſome points Fundamentall, and ſome not Fundamentall.</hi> Therefore the words are according to Saint Auſtin, and that is well. Next in <hi>the matters themſelues,</hi> alſo, he ſayes, <hi>Catholicke Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines make ſome diſtinction, and hold ſome to be more neceſſary to be actually, and expreſly knowne of all ſorts; then other:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he quarrels at that, which himſelfe confeſſes to be the truth. There be ſome humours loue to be doing, if it be but to keepe their hand in vre.
<note n="*" place="margin">Maiol dies Canic.</note> I haue read of one that had ſo vſed himſelfe to pilfring, that he would pick his owne purſe, and ſteale things out of his owne cloſet. The Ieſuite ſeems to be of that kindred; that will quarrell, and keepe a wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the doctrine of his owne Church, rather then he will ceaſe from his contentious ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Yet the ſaddle, ſomewhere pinches him, and it may be the eaſing of him, may do him good. He complains this diſtinction, when it is granted, <hi>will not helpe the matter nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for the queſtion may ſtill be, how many, and which truthes thoſe be that are neceſſary: the which queſtion if we leaue to be determinated by euery priuate ſpirit, either we ſhall haue no point to be counted Fundamentall, in regard the ignorance of ſome may be ſuch, that they may thinke a man may be ſaued by morall good life, although through ignorance he beleeue nothing at all; or elſe ſo many as ſhall pleaſe euery brainſicke fellow. The determination therefore of this neceſſary queſtion, is to be left to the iudgement of the Catholicke Church, that all ſuch points that are confirmed by full authority of the ſaid Church he
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:20570:97"/> receiued for ſuch as muſt neceſſarily be beleeued by all men.</hi> Wherein firſt I blame his diſcretion: for where I mentioned the diſtinction, I had no cauſe to inquire, <hi>whoſe</hi> the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is to iudge, what is Fundamentall, and what otherwiſe; but aſſuming it, as a thing iudged already, I onely mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it; affirming ſome points to be Fundamentall, and ſome otherwiſe. <hi>How it helps the matter</hi> therefore, I had nothing to do, in that my words were not vſed in this queſtion. Next I pittie his wretched ſtate, that in no controuerſie run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning betweene vs, no not ſo much as in this, a poore diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can preuaile, vnleſſe his owne Church, and the Pope therein (for
<note n="*" place="margin">Shewed plainely below, cap 35. &amp; 36.</note> that he meanes by <hi>the authority of the Catholicke Church</hi>) be made the iudge. This is a very meane ſhift, when a queſtion depends betweene vs, and them, to put the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the conſent of the Ancient Church by; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire themſelues to be iudges. Thirdly this <hi>queſtion,</hi> as all other matters belonging to faith, muſt be iudged by no mans <hi>priuate ſpirit,</hi> but by the Catholicke <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> as the Iudge, and by the <hi>Scripture onely</hi> as the Rule: and if they be no competent Iudges, who <hi>through ignorance may thinke a man may be ſaued by morall good life, though he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue nothing at all;</hi> then away with the Church of Rome, and let it be acknowledged as erroneous, as any <hi>priuate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">See cap. 22. n. 1.</note> wherein it is frequently holden, that the Gentiles were iuſtified, and might be ſaued, onely by their <hi>morall life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beleeueing any thing at all.</hi> Fourthly ſuppoſing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, left the determining of this queſtion to priuate ſpirit, (which they do not, but to the true Church of God, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Scripture) yet let my Ieſuite anſwer, if the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of his owne Church be not as bad, where the Pope hath power

                  <q>A. D. I will inſiſt in that example, which I propounded,
<note place="margin">Pag. 68.</note> in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, and thus I diſpute: <hi>All ſorts, both Catholickes, and Protestants, do beleeue, and hold it a point neceſſary to be beleeued, that S. Mathewes, S. Marks Goſpell, &amp;c. are true diuine Scripture, and that theſe particular bookes, which the Church vſeth, are the ſame true Scripture, at leaſt in ſenſe, and ſubſtance, which was ſet downe by thoſe holy writers. But theſe points are not expreſſed in Scripture: nor (ſecluding Church authority, and tradition) ſo contained, as that they can be proued euidently, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily out of any ſentence of Scripture. Ergo, all points neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, are not ſo contained in Scripture, as Proteſtants ſay they are.</hi> M. Wotton, and M. White both ſtruggle with this argument, as other Proteſtants haue done before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but when they haue done &amp; ſaid all, one may eaſily ſee how they <hi>ſticke faſt in the mire.</hi> To omit their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent ſpeeches, there are onely two things, which to the purpoſe, they do, or can directly ſay; viz. either they muſt deny theſe to be <hi>points of faith,</hi> neceſſary to be beleeued, or elſe they muſt ſhew, how one may prooue theſe points euidently out of ſome ſentence of <hi>Scripture.</hi> For if they admit that theſe be <hi>points of faith,</hi> neceſſary to be beleeued, and that theſe cannot be prooued out of <hi>Scripture;</hi> it followeth ineuitably, that <hi>all points of faith neceſſary to be beleeued, cannot be prooued by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> and that their Principle is falſe, which ſaith, nothing is neceſſary to be beleeued, as a point of ſaith, which cannot be prooued (eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently) by Scripture M. White ſaith, that like as in other ſciences,
<note place="margin">White pag. 47.</note> there are ſome Principles indemonſtrable, ſo in matters of faith, it is <hi>a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> to be ſuppoſed, that Scripture is Diuine; and ſo no maruell, if it cannot be prooued, as other points of faith are. To this I reply, that <hi>Principles</hi> in ſciences are either <hi>euident</hi> to vs, and knowne by the onely light of nature, and ſo neede no proofe, but onely declaration of terms, or words in which they be vttered; or if they be <hi>not euident</hi> to vs, they muſt be demonſtrated, either in the ſame ſcience, or in ſome ſuperior ſcience, by ſome other Principle, more euident to vs. But that theſe books which are in the Bible, are diuine Scripture, is
<note n="*" place="margin">If it were eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, how is it onely beleeued by faith? For S. Paul calls faith argumentum non apparenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. Heb. 11. v. 1.</note> not euident; therefore (if M. Whites ſimilitude be good) it muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:20570:100"/> by ſome other Principle, more euidently vnto vs, that theſe books, which are in the Bible, be diuine Scripture. Secondly, I aske, whether this point of doctrine (that S. Mathewes Goſpell, &amp;c. is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Scripture) be ſuch a Principle of faith, as it ſelfe is alſo a point ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be beleeued, and that by the ſame infallible faith, by which we beleeue the bleſſed Trinity? Or that it is ſo a Principle, as it ſelfe is not to be beleeued at all by faith, or by the ſame faith, by which wee beleeue the bleſſed Trinity? If the firſt be ſaid; then either the opinion of Proteſtants, who ſay, <hi>nothing is to be neceſſarily beleeued as a point of faith, which cannot be prooued out of the Scripture,</hi> is falſe, or elſe this is not <hi>a Principle indemonstrable,</hi> as M. White affirmeth. If rhe ſecond be ſaid, then it followeth, that Proteſtants do not beleeue by faith, S. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewes, S. Marks Goſpell, &amp;c. nor any other booke in the Bible to be diuine Scripture: and conſequently not hauing aſſurance of diuine faith, in this point, they cannot haue any faith at all in any other points; ſince other points being not otherwiſe (in a Proteſtants iudgement) points of faith, then as they are concluſions prooued out of Scripture, cannot be more aſſuredly knowne, then Scripture it ſelfe, which is the onely Premiſe, or Principle, whence Proteſtants deduce all other points of their faith.</q>

Otherwiſe my anſwer, was direct, and plaine: for the point he is to proue, is, that <hi>the Scripture alone containes not, nor determines the whole obiect of our faith:</hi> but diuers points needfull to be beleeued are wanting in it, and muſt be ſupplied by the authority, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church: his reaſon to proue this is the Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme here ſet downe. Whereto I anſwered. Firſt granting the maior, and acknowledging it to be a point of faith, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be beleeued, that the Canonicall bookes, which the Church vſes, are true diuine Scripture: but I denied the ſecond propoſition, that they cannot be proued ſo to be, by themſelues, ſecluding Church authority and tradition. And I diſtinguiſh: for the Authority, and direction of the Church, is Gods outward ordinance to teach vs, as a <hi>condition,</hi> how to ſee the Scripture to be diuine; but not <hi>the thing</hi> whereby they are prooued ſo to be, and whereon our faith leaneth: but this diuinity, the Church as <hi>a bare Miniſter,</hi> out of the Scripture it ſelfe, prooues to be in the Scripture, not by <hi>her owne</hi> authority, that vpon her word, and teſtimony, either onely, or particularly it ſhould be taken for Scripture, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the books of other men. In the ſame manner that a man ſhewes a ſtar giuing light to it ſelfe, which yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cannot ſee till the man point to it. Or as a dead mans will kept in the Regiſter, of neceſſity muſt be ſought there, and thence receiued: yet all the authority of that court, which is great, and ample (ſpecially in preſeruing records) neither <hi>makes,</hi> nor <hi>prooues</hi> the will to be legitimate, but is onely <hi>a requiſite condition</hi> to bring it forth, and vs to the ſight and knowledge of it, the will proouing <hi>it ſelfe</hi> by the hand and ſeale of him that made it, affixed to it. So it is with the word of God, which we do not ordinarily ſee to be the word of God, vntill the Church teach, and traine vs vp there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. But when it hath done, the arguments whereby it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſo to be, and the authority whereupon I beleeue it, are
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:20570:101"/> contained in the word it ſelfe, which I expound, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme by this, that euermore, and perpetually the Church, by the Scripture it ſelfe, and by no other argument, prooues it to be diuine, to thoſe ſhe teaches, and vpon that ground, at the firſt receiued them for ſuch her ſelfe: and many times it fals out, as with ſome Atheiſts, and Pagans, that where no Church authority, miniſtry, or perſwaſion is vſed, by onely reading of the Scripture <hi>it ſelfe,</hi> in reſpect of the outward meanes, a man coms to faith; which could not be if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe had not conuinced him: forſomuch as an Atheiſt, or vnbeleeuer will not be perſwaded by any thing, but that which he euidently ſees to be Gods owne word: and this perſwaſion ariſes in him, from the very booke it ſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Church authority.</p>

Firſt, that <hi>the faithfull,</hi> who acknowledge the Scripture to be Gods word, are they perſons of whom they ſpeake: &amp; not ſuch as receiue it not. Secondly, that <hi>to ſuch</hi> it may be prooued, that not the inward ſpirit of fantaſticall men, but the Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is the word of God. Wherein they affirme two things may be prooued: A Negatiue: that the inward ſpirit is not Gods word: and an Affirmatiue: that <hi>Gods word is truely it which is contained in the Canonicall books</hi> of the Scripture. Thirdly, that both this Negatiue and this Affirmatiue may
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:20570:101"/> be proued <hi>out of the Scriptures themſelues.</hi> Hence I reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus: To <hi>the godly</hi> that receiue and acknowledge the Scripture, this affirmatiue, that <hi>Gods word is it which is contained in the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Bookes</hi> of the Scripture, may be proued out of <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelues:</hi> therefore the Scripture it ſelfe can proue it ſelfe to be the word of God. Therefore, that the Scripture it the very word of God, is contained in the Scripture becauſe otherwiſe it could not be proued ſo to be out of <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe.</hi> Therefore all things needfull are contained in this Scripture. No wrangling can auoid this. If, to ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them, it may be proued, out of themſelues, that theſe Bookes are the word of God; then this point, that <hi>theſe bookes are diuine Scripture,</hi> is contained in Scripture: and the cauſe why ſome ſee it not, is their owne indiſpoſition and vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, wherewith the Scripture muſt not be charged: but to ſuch as receiue theſe Bookes, the Ieſuits affirme it may be proued, <hi>out of themſelues,</hi> that they are the word of God: that is, <hi>without all Church authoritie,</hi> which is externall and not in the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Secondlie, this being admitted, that it is a <hi>a point of faith neceſſary to be beleeued, that the Canonical Books are diuine;</hi> and then againe, that they could not be ſhewed ſo to be out of <hi>themſelues;</hi> yet doth it not follow <hi>ineuitably, that all points of faith are not contained in them:</hi> for the queſtion is not <hi>whether the Scripture be Gods word, or no,</hi> which is granted of all hands; but <hi>whether being confeſſed ſo to be, it containe all ſuch verities, as a Chriſtian man is bound to know: in ſuch meaſure, that there is no point to be beleeued, that is not contained therein.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe the Scriptures are the principles of diuine knowledge: and the faith thereof,
<note n="*" place="margin">Not in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</note> like the credite we yeed to the rules of humane ſciences, which are knowne, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued of themſelues without any further demonſtration. And as the kings lawes containe all things, whatſoeuer the ſubiect is bound to do, and yet the ſaid lawes, not prouing themſelues to be of authoritie; but ſuppoſing it to be known before, and otherwiſe; are not thereby proued to be <hi>vnperfect,</hi> or <hi>defectiue,</hi> but being receiued, then there is nothing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:20570:102"/> in them, that is neceſſary for the common-wealth: and as in all arts, and ſciences, that we learne, the rules, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts thereof need not proue themſelues, (for that which is the generall rule of other things is not ruled it ſelfe, in the ſame kinde) and yet it were folly to ſay, <hi>they were</hi> therefore <hi>imperfect:</hi> So may it be ſaid to be in the Scripture (ſuppoſing it had no more light, thereby to authorize it ſelfe, then Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces lawes, and humane principles haue) that it containes <hi>all points of faith,</hi> though it were not expreſſed, that it ſelfe is the word of God. For the readier vnderſtanding whereof, let the Reader againe caſt his eie vpon the occaſion whereof all this queſtion riſes.</p>

                  <q>5 Our Aduerſaries holding many points of religion, which we refuſe, we require them to ſhew vs the ſaid points in the Scriptures, if they will either haue vs to beleeue them, or free themſelues from hereſie: their <hi>Tradition,</hi> their <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> their <hi>Maſſe,</hi> their <hi>Latine ſeruice,</hi> their <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> their <hi>Images,</hi> their <hi>ſeuen Sacraments,</hi> their <hi>Inuocation of Saints,</hi> and all the reſt, wherein we differ.

                  </q> This is the originall reaſon why they ſtand thus, againſt the ſufficiency of the written word, for their <hi>Church authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:</hi> and to proue this, they vſe the Argument here propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Reply: and deſcant with it as you ſee. Which is an impertinent kinde of proceeding; when this point, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Bookes contained in holy writ, be Gods word,</hi> is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion betweene vs, but agreed vpon of all hands: but the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is touching other ſpeciall articles, <hi>Images, adoration, halfe communion,</hi> and ſuch like, a number more; whether, not being contained in the Scripture, men are bound to beleeue them. For touching theſe things it is properly that we ſay, <hi>Nothing is neceſſary to be beleeued, as a point of faith, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be prooued euidently by Scripture.</hi> And therefore this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is impertinent. For where we affirme all points of faith to be compriſed, within the body of the Scripture, we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:20570:102"/> firſt, of <hi>the things</hi> which we ſay are compriſed: for albeit we firmely hold, the diuine truth, and authoritie of theſe Bookes to be euident in themſelues; yet the points, that we meane in this queſtion are touching other matters: for neither they nor we deny the Scripture, but both they, and we deny many things to be contained in it. Secondly, then againe of <hi>the manner how</hi> things are compriſed: for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things are compriſed in Scripture, as the duty, &amp; obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſubiects is in the kings lawes; and as true ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is contained in Grammar, or the right forme of reſoluing in Logicke: but this one point is ſo contained as light is in the Sunne, or ſweete in hony, and according to the ſame no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby the authoritie of the Law, and truth of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, is contained in themſelues. This is it, which very briefly, I anſwered in
<note n="*" place="margin">THE WAIE § 9. 3. &amp; digr. 11. n. 17.</note> two ſeuerall places of my Booke: Now let us ſee, what the Ieſuite replies to it. <hi>To this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that principles inſciences are either euident to vs, and knowne by the onely light of nature, and ſo neede no proofe, but onely decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of termes, or words, in which they be vttered; or if they be not euident to vs, they muſt be demonſtrated, either in the ſame ſcience, or in ſome ſuperiour ſcience, by ſome other principle, more euident to vs. But that theſe Bookes, which are in the Bible are diuine Scripture, is not euident; therefore (if M. Whites ſimilitude be good) it muſt be demonſtrated by ſome other principle more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to vs, that theſe Bookes which are in the Bible, be diuine Scripture.</hi> The ſubſtance of his Reply is, that all principles are either euident of themſelues: or not euident: ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as are <hi>euident,</hi> he grants, need no prouing, but the Scriptures are principles of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>not euident</hi> of themſelues, but <hi>ſuch as need to be demonſtrated, to be Gods word, by ſome other principle in a higher ſcience, more euident to vs:</hi> both denying them to be euident, and alſo to be made ſo, by <hi>onely declaring the words,</hi> wherein they are vttered. And to proue this, he ſaies, in the margent, <hi>if it were euident</hi> (that theſe Bookes in the Bible are diuine Scripture) <hi>how is it onely beleeued by faith, for Saint Paule cals faith Argumentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non apparentium? Heb.</hi> 11.1. 1. My anſwer is, that the Scriptures are principles <hi>euident of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:20570:103"/> themſelues,</hi> to thoſe that haue the Spirit of God, and ſuch as need not to be proued by Church authoritie, but onely to be reuealed, and expounded, according to that which is in themſelues. This my anſwer to helpe the reader out of the Ieſuits perplexed diſcourſe, I will lay downe, and explicate in 3. propoſitions. Firſt, <hi>the Scripture in diuinitie hath the ſame office, that principles haue in ſciences:</hi> that as the rules, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Grammar teach all true ſpeaking, and as the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Arithmeticke teach all right numbring: ſo the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contained in the Scriptures teaches all true faith. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>as they are the principles of religion, and rule of faith, ſo they enioy the ſame priuiledge, that principles do in forren Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions; that is, to be receiued, and aſſented to, for themſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcourſe.</hi> For
<note n="e" place="margin">Atiſt. Poſter. c. 1.</note> no humane ſcience proues it owne prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or diſputes againſt him, that denies them: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the principles of an inferiour ſcience may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in a ſuperiour, yet this befalles not that which is <hi>the higheſt,</hi> as the Metaphyſicks; which hauing no ſuperiour ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, neither ſtands to demonſtrate it ſelfe, nor to receiue demonſtration from another, but our vnderſtanding aſſents immediatly to the principles thereof, and ſo goes forward by them, to diſcerne of other things. In the ſame manner the Scripture, hauing no ſuperiour ſcience, or rule aboue it, is, like theſe principles, receiued <hi>for it ſelfe,</hi> and is not occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in prouing it ſelfe, and the principles therin contained; but ſhewing other things by them, it ſelfe muſt be aſſented to without diſcourſe, by faith, before we can argue out of it. Thirdly, <hi>all demonſtration, and proofe of principles is onely volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, not neceſſarie, againſt him that denies them:</hi> as in Muſicke, the Muſitian demonſtrates his precepts, not thereby to teach his arte, but to conuince him that denies it. Hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares the inſufficiency of my aduerſaries reply. Firſt in that he ſaies, <hi>principles are not euident,</hi> but need demonſtration, that ſo the Scriptures being yeelded to be <hi>the principles</hi> of religion, yet they ſhould not be receiued, vnleſſe they proue themſelues, vntill the authoritie of the Church come. There is no man acquainted with

Next it is falſe, that the Scripture is like <hi>thoſe principles which need demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſome other principle in a higher art, more euident to vs.</hi> Here are two vntruths.

<note n="i" place="margin">Vbi ſupra.</note> ſayes, <hi>The ſacred Scripture hath no higher ſcience.</hi> The ſetting vp of the Pope, and his Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue it, to giue it authoritie, as <hi>a higher ſcience</hi> giues to a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, is a blaſphemous practiſe of Antichriſt. Bozius
<note n="k" place="margin">Boz. de ſign. eccl. tom. 2. pag. 439.</note> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that <hi>the Scripture is not to be reckoned among ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as before all things are to be credited; but it is proued and confirmed by the Church, as by a certaine principle, which hath authoritie to reiect and allow Scripture.</hi> Let the Reader, by theſe words of Bozius, a famous Papiſt, conſter my aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries meaning in this place: if he chance to ſay, he meanes not, as I charge him. Againe it is falſe, that the Church is <hi>more euident to</hi> vs then the Scripture, in that ſenſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to this queſtion: I ſee indeed the Church that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches me, before I beleeue the Scripture to be diuine (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing I were a Pagan, that as yet had not receiued the Scripture) but I beleeue the Scripture to be diuine, and am conuinced in my conſcience that it is the word of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can beleeue the Church ſayes true. For I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it ſayes true, but vpon the grounds of Scripture, which it offers me; and therefore conſequently the truth of the Scripture is more euident then the truth of the Church. In which caſe it is, as when a man ſtands in the doore with a torch in his hand, to giue light to ſuch as need; where he holds out the torch indeed, yet he puts no light into it, nor does any thing, but onely hold it before them. The Church-authoritie, in miniſtring to vs, doth no more to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then this man doth to his torch. I wil yet vſe a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar conpariſon, whereby the Reader ſhall ſee, how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly my aduerſary holds the Church to be <hi>more euident</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:20570:104"/> then the Scriptures, and to giue them <hi>authoritie, which they haue not of themſelues,</hi> becauſe it propounds, and perſwades them vnto vs. <hi>Seius</hi> owes <hi>Caius</hi> mony vpon a bond; that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on truſt, and for the better keeping thereof, is put into the hands of <hi>Titius.</hi> For the proofe of this debt, it is neceſſary that <hi>Titius</hi> bring forth the bond; but when he hath done, I demand, whence hath the bond his credit? How is it proued to be <hi>Seius</hi> his true deed, rather then a counterfet? Not by <hi>Titius</hi> his authoritie, becauſe he brings it forth, but by it ſelf; in that the hand and ſeale thereof manifeſt themſelues to be <hi>Seius</hi> his: <hi>Titius</hi> that keeps it, is but a means to bring it forth. But what if <hi>Seius</hi> denie the debt, that <hi>Caius</hi> be enforced to ſue him, and by law to caſt him; who giue, <hi>Caius</hi> the right, and makes <hi>Seius</hi> his debtor? and who makes the bond of force? doth the Iudge; before whom the cauſe is tried? The ſimpleſt man in the countrey will not ſay ſo: for the bond both proues it ſelf, and giues <hi>Caius</hi> his right, and make, <hi>Seius</hi> a debtor; when the Iudge onely giues it execution, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares no more, but that which was in the bond before. Let the <hi>Scripture</hi> be compared to this bond; and let my aduerſary put me to proue that it is the word of God, as <hi>Caius</hi> is put to proue his bond; and it wil manifeſtly appeare, that though the Church haue ſome <hi>miniſtery</hi> in propounding it, yet that <hi>miniſtery</hi> or <hi>authoritie,</hi> call it what you will, doth no more then the Iudge in this caſe doth. It is not <hi>a principle aboue</hi> the Scripture, or <hi>more euident,</hi> whereby the truth thereof is <hi>proued:</hi> as the Iudges authoritie <hi>proues</hi> not the bond.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Our aduerſaries, when they haue wrangled what they can, are inforced to confeſſe thus much, in that they grant <hi>the laſt and higheſt reſolution of our faith to be into the authoritie of the Scripture.</hi> And let the Reader diligently obſerue, how it comes about. In euery controuerſie, and article of faith, they ſay, they are moued by the authoritie of the Church, they beleeue the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be Gods true word, becauſe God hath ſo reuealed by the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible authoritie of the Church.

For I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it is written in theſe three places, whereof he hath here rehearſed two. Now he replies, that he doth not onely enquire <hi>how we proue in generall that there is any diuine Scripture</hi> at all, but <hi>how we proue theſe bookes,</hi> which the Church now vſes, to be the ſame that thoſe men writ, whoſe titles they beare: which, he ſayes, cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>by the Scriptures alledged; becauſe it may ſtill be doubted, whether theſe bookes that we vſe, as the Gospell of Matthew and Marke for example, be part of that Scripture which the texts alledged affirme to be inspired of God: and it muſt likewiſe be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that theſe texts that affirme this, are themſelues the word of God.</hi> Whereto I anſwer firſt, that granting theſe places to proue ſome diuine Scripture to be, and to be inſpired of God, it muſt be granted, that the Scripture may be proued
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:20570:106"/> ſo to be, <hi>by the Scripture</hi> it ſelfe. For theſe ſentences, <hi>All Scripture is giuen by inspiration: Holy men ſpake as they were moued by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and ſuch like places, could not proue ſo much as in generall, that any bookes at all, whether it were theſe that we vſe, or no, are diuine Scripture, if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues were not diuine. I ſay they could not <hi>proue</hi> it <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>effectually;</hi> they might <hi>ſay</hi> it, but they could not <hi>proue</hi> it, becauſe that which ſhall <hi>proue</hi> it, muſt it ſelfe firſt be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine teſtimonie. Secondly, prouing ſome diuine Scripture to be, and to be inſpired, they proue <hi>this that we vſe</hi> to be ſuch: becauſe they ſo mention the Scripture they ſpeake of, that it appeares to be <hi>this that we vſe;</hi> and it is agreed vpon of all hands, that there is no ſcripture but <hi>this:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeaking of ſome ſcripture, they ſpeake of <hi>this.</hi> This is my argument, <hi>That Scripture, whereof the ſentences alledged ſpeake, is proued thereby to be diuine: But the ſentences alledged, speake of the ſame Scripture that we vſe:</hi> For the Church hath alwayes vnderſtood it ſo. <hi>The ſentences therefore alledged, proue this Scripture that we vſe, to be diuine.</hi> And ſo my aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries demaund is ſatisfied: <hi>I enquire not onely how it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by Scripture, that there is ſome diuine Scripture which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired by God: but that theſe bookes in particular are that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi> For if it giue any teſtimonie at all, to any Scripture at all, it is to <hi>theſe</hi> bookes in particular, which are <hi>now</hi> vſed: in that it deſcribes <hi>theſe</hi> bookes, neither are there, or haue there bene any other; nor dares the Church of Rome it ſelfe hitherto canonize any other, howſoeuer ſome therein think it may.</p>

For if the Church-authoritie make them to be canonicall, and diuine
<note n="*" place="margin">For that is it properly, that the Papiſts ſay, Bellar. Stapl. Grego.</note> 
                     <hi>to vs,</hi> then it is either by <hi>adding</hi> truth, diuinitie, authoritie to them, which they had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in themſelues by diuine inſpiration; or onely by <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> and <hi>reuealing</hi> to vs that truth, diuinitie and authoritie, which they haue immediatly from God, of themſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church approued them, that we might ſee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it. The former our aduerſaries will not ſay; or if they will, it is Atheiſme, worſe then blaſphemie: for ſo all our faith, and the higheſt reaſon mouing vs to beleeue, ſhould not be diuine reuelation, but humane authoritie; and the Scripture, which of it ſelfe had no truth or diuine inſpiration, ſhould be canonized by men. If the latter, which our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries dare not denie, then who ſees not, that they proue themſelues, and in themſelues haue diuine authoritie imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly from God; the Church-authoritie in approuing them, being nothing elſe but <hi>bare miniſterie</hi> (in reſpect of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though in regard of vs it be authoritie) in helping vs to ſee that which is in themſelues. When the King ſtampes coine, and ſignes it with his image and ſuperſcription, he puts that valew and currentneſſe into it, that was not there before. Thus a ſmall peece of copper, of it ſelfe originally not worth a penie, may be made worth ſixe pence. Thus the Church authorizes not the Scripture. Stapleton
<note n="f" place="margin">Staplet. relect pag. 505. in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicat. art.</note> ſayes, <hi>The Church approues not the Scripture the firſt way by making it ſacred &amp; diuine, for this approbation it hath onely from the holy Ghoſt the author thereof, of whom alone it hath to be ſacred, and not humane: nor the ſecond way by making that through her iudgement it ſhould be accepted for true, and worthy credit — becauſe that which is in the Scripture, is the diuine truth</hi> BY IT SELFE, AND IS NOT MADE TRVE BY THE AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PROBATION OF THE CHVRCH. <hi>But the third way, in that by the force of her approofe and iudgement, they are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the faithfull for ſacred and diuine, and infallible true. And
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:20570:107"/> thus we beleeue theſe Scriptures to be Canonicall for the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the Church.</hi> The King ſends a commiſſion vnder ſeale, by a meſſenger; this meſſenger giues no <hi>authoritie</hi> to the commiſſion, but is the Kings <hi>miniſter,</hi> authorized to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it to the ſubiects. Thus the Church giues teſtimonie to the Scriptures, that it is diuine, and no otherwiſe; and it ſelfe fetches this teſtimonie from the Scripture; and all the authoritie thereof is laſtly reſolued into the teſtimonie of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Next, theſe Scriptures are <hi>proued</hi> to be diuine, by <hi>their owne</hi> light ſhining, and by <hi>their owne</hi> vertue ſhewing it ſelfe in them: as ſweetneſſe is knowne by it owne taſte; and the Sunne ſeene by it owne light: and as the Kings coine is knowne by his image vpon it; and the fathers voice is knowne to his children by the ſound and faſhion thereof: ſo are theſe Scriptures by the heauenly light, image and ſound, inſpired into them, knowne to be the word of God.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:20570:112"/> are not prooued, and confirmed euidently, and expreſly by the holy Scripture, and where the Church hath not determined their firme, and vndoubted ſoothfaſtnes. Whence it followes, that an opinion cannot preciſely be conuinced of hereſie by the ſaying of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: for where where is not infallible truth, there is no certaine faith: ſince certaine faith leanes vpon infallible truth, yea there can be no infallible aſſent, that a man ſhould firmely cleaue to ſuch things: for when there is no infallible truth, there can be no certaine, and vndoubted faith. — But in the ſaying of the Doctors, there is no infallible, certaine, or vndoubted truth, partly becauſe, they ſometime doubt themſelues in their owne ſayings, whether they haue erred therein, or no: — partly becauſe, their diſagreement is a teſtimony of falſity:—and what diſagreement there is among the Doctors, no man doubts, that hath read their writings. — It is not neceſſary therefore, vndoubtingly to beleeue them, but it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to</hi> THINKE AGAINST THEM, DISALOW THEM, AND REIECT THEM <hi>without any danger of hereſie.</hi> So he. And yet you ſee, how buſily my aduerſary taxes Proteſtants for <hi>neglecting</hi> the Fathers, like the crabfiſh, that chid her yong one for creeping backward, and yet went backward her ſelfe: it were an honeſter courſe, and more reliſhing of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for our aduerſaries to ſpare our diſſenting ſometime from the Fathers, as they do their owne: &amp; onely inquire whether we diſſent with reaſon, as themſelues ſometimes do: but this were labour, and expence: a Ieſuites pen can afford railing, and facing a great deale better cheape.</p>

               <p n="4">4. The third thing he ſayes, is, that <hi>this Church Militant, and Catholicke, to keepe the Antitheſis,</hi> I ſhould either haue called <hi>the Church Triumphant, not as Catholickes meane Triumphant; but becauſe being viſible, it may triumph indeed, in that no perſecutors can find, know, or hurt them.</hi> But this foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh conceite auoids not that I ſaid, but idlely, and rudely

In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, the Proteſtants inuiſible Church, may be called a Church Lamentant, or a Lamentable Church.</hi> This is the Ieſuites cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity: and yet a well digeſted anſwer, to that I ſaid touching theſe matters, would haue more preuailed with all that loue the truth.

                  <q>A.D. Concerning the fourth Chapter —
<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 137.</note> My principall conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in this chapter, to wit, that <hi>Faith muſt be intire,</hi> is againſt ſuch, as thinke it ſufficient to beleeue one, or two, or ſome few articles of Chriſtian faith; thinking it not needfull, vnder paine of damnation to beleeue all: but rather thinke they may doubt of, or deny other points, although knowne to be held, as points of faith, by the Catholicke Church. Againſt whom I affirme, that <hi>Faith muſt be intire;</hi> and it muſt extend it ſelfe, vniuerſally to all points, either <hi>expreſſely,</hi> or <hi>implicitely:</hi> and that it is damnable to deny raſhly, eſpecially obſtinately, any one point, which one either knoweth, or (in regard he hath it ſufficiently propounded by the Church) ought to know, to be reuealed by God. Againſt this my concluſion both my aduerſaies, do oppoſe themſelues —<hi>Againe</hi>—
<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 139.</note> Secondly whereas I inſinuate, a generall or implicite beleefe of ſome points of faith, to ſuffice ſome perſons, at leaſt in ſome caſes, M. Wotton admitteth it, which I gratefully accept: but cannot ſee how this will pleaſe his fellow M. White, who ſo hoatly diſputeth againſt implicite beleefe (as it ſeemeth) of any point of faith;
<note n="1" place="margin">White pag. 7.</note> when he asketh, <hi>to what purpoſe ſhould God propound all the points of our faith, one as well as another, if his will were not that we ſhould learne all?</hi> This opinion of M. Whites (if he meane it ſo vniuerſally, as his wordes ſound) is intollerable, and ſuch as might driue, at leaſt vnlearned men, to deſpaire of ſaluation, in regard it is impoſſible for them without mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, to get expreſſe knowledge of all points, contained in Scripture; all which are points of faith, and conſequently are points neceſſary to be beleeued, either expreſſely, and in particular, or implicitely, and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:20570:116"/> in generall, vnder paine of damnation. Indeed I do grant, and neuer did deny, but that there are ſome points neceſſary, to be particularly knowne of all ſorts, <hi>neceſſitate medij,</hi> and ſome neceſſary to be known, <hi>neceſſitate praecepti.</hi> In which points, implicite beleefe doth not ſuffice, but expreſſe particular knowledge is required by Catholicke Diuines, to be ioyned to the aſſent of our faith. Whereby appeareth, that M. White doth vtter two groſſe vntruthes,
<note n="2" place="margin">White p. 5. &amp; 7.</note> when he ſaies, that we <hi>vtterly refuſe knowledge,</hi> and that <hi>the Colliars faith is canonized for</hi> our <hi>Creed.</hi> In other points ſo farre as we neither know, nor haue ſufficient meanes to know them, we may well commend the Colliars faith, in beleeuing in generall, as the Church beleeueth. For in this generall act, is infol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a vertuall, or implicite beleefe, of all points; both in regard a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall includeth all particulars contained in it, as alſo for that this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar act of beleeuing the Church, <hi>eo ipſo</hi> (in that we are moued vnto it by the authority of diuine reuelation, as the primary, or formall cauſe, and by the authoritie of the Church it ſelfe, as a neceſſary condition, or the ſecondary cauſe) doth ſo diſpoſe the minde of the beleeuer, that he is ready to beleeue, euerie other point, reuealed by God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Church.—<hi>Againe.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 140.</note> Thirdly whereas M. White
<note n="3" place="margin">White p. 5.</note> requireth <hi>particular knowledge, to be ioyned with the aſſent of faith,</hi> as though he meant, that one could not beleeue any point of faith, which he did not firſt expreſſely, and in particular know; this his aſſertion is not onely contrarie to his fellow M. Wotton,
<note place="margin">Wotton p. 46.</note> who admitteth a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, or implicite beleefe of ſome points, which we do not in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular know;
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. v. 2.</note> but it is alſo againſt the Scriptures, Fathers, and naturall reaſon it ſelfe. In the Scriptures we haue, that not onely <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>knowledge,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11. v. 1.</note> are 2. diſtinct things; but alſo that faith is of things not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, or not knowne, and that faith doth <hi>captiuate the vnderſtanding for the ſeruice of Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Cor. 10 v. 5. Rom. 10. v. 16.</note> requiring an obedience in the beleeuer: all which were not verified, if <hi>expreſſe, particular diſtinct</hi> knowledge, were preſuppoſed before beleefe: or if beleefe, and ſuch knowledge, were all one thing.

               <p n="1">1 FOr the reducing of this wilde diſcourſe into ſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the better diſcerning of the controuerſie, you are to note that the Ieſuite, in the beginning of his Treatiſe, laied downe 4. propoſitions touching faith; out of the which he would ſpin his motiues to Papiſtry: the firſt is, that <hi>Faith is neceſſary to ſaluation.</hi> The ſecond, that <hi>this faith is</hi> but <hi>only one.</hi> The third, that <hi>it muſt be infallible.</hi> The fourth, that <hi>it muſt be entire, extending it ſelfe to all points vniuerſally.</hi> This concluſion I graunted in one ſenſe, and denied in another: That our beleefe muſt be entire, whole, and ſound in all points <hi>by obtaining a particular diſtinct knowledge of the ſame in our ſelues:</hi> that ſo our faith might include an apprehenſion, and knowledge of that we beleeue, as well as an aſſent in the will; I granted: but if his meaning were, that which then I

               <p n="2">2 That which he ſayes, is two things. Firſt, he repeates, and expounds his concluſion: Next he touches ſome ſmall portion of that I ſaid concerning it.

When that doctrine allowes ignorance in all points; and the other, which is ſomewhat honeſter, allowes it in more points, and defines the ignorance otherwiſe, then M. Wootton will do. My aduerſary therefor hath not M. Wootton on his ſide; nor againſt me; but directly with me againſt himſelfe. To the ſecond, that my opinion for the knowledge of all points of faith, one as well as another, <hi>is intollerable, becauſe it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for vnlearned men, to get expreſſe knowledge of all points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture:</hi> I anſwer, that my words alleadged do not affirme the neceſſity of knowing <hi>all things</hi> reuealed (as that Iacob had a lame leg, or Abraham two wiues) but all points <hi>of our faith;</hi> expounding <hi>faith,</hi> not as he doth, for <hi>euery thing that is reuealed,</hi> but of the <hi>ſubſtantiall</hi> articles of faith, which the vnlearnedſt that are may learne, and vnderſtand, if they will vſe the Miniſtry of the Church, and exerciſe their wits therin, as the word requires.

                  <q>A. D. Concerning the fift Chapter,
<note place="margin">Pag. 143.</note> the concluſion of this Chapter (to wit, that <hi>God hath prouided ſome ordinary rule, and meanes by which all ſorts, as well vnlearned, as learned, may be inſtructed ſufficiently in that one infallible entire faith, which is neceſſary to ſaluation</hi>) ſerueth chiefely for thoſe who either preſume to attaine this <hi>faith,</hi> without v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any endeuour, in ſeeking, or following ſome <hi>ordinary rule and meanes;</hi> or elſe deſpaire, in regard they know not, what in particular this <hi>rule, and meanes,</hi> is: nor perhaps in generall, that there is at all, any <hi>ordinarie rule, and meanes,</hi> (at leaſt accommodated to their capacitie) prouided by God, by which they may be ſufficiently inſtructed in faith. To take away therfore the foreſaid preſumption of ſome, and deſpaire of others, in this Chapter I onely intended to proue in generall, that <hi>there is ſome certaine ordinary rule, and meanes, ordained by God,</hi> which if one neglect to ſeeke, finde, and follow (according to the ordinary courſe of Gods prouidence) he may not (be he neuer ſo learned, or wiſe) preſume, or hope to attaine true faith: and which whoſoeuer doth diligently ſeeke, happily finde, and obediently follow (be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo vnlearned, or ſimple) he need not deſpaire, or doubt, but may reſt aſſured, that he ſhall attaine vnto it. My aduerſaries do not ſeeme to deny this my concluſion, ſo farre as it, doth properly belong to this Chapter: but fearing what may follow of it, they oppoſe againſt that <hi>ſence</hi> which they imagine, I intended afterward to draw out of it. But this is vnorderly to runne before the hare. Let vs now onely ſpeake to the purpoſe of the preſent Chapter. M. White expreſſely
<note n="*" place="margin">White pag. 8. &amp; 9.</note> graunteth, and M. Wootton doth not deny, that there is <hi>ſome certaine rule,</hi> and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:20570:125"/> 
                     <hi>meanes,</hi> appointed by God, and left in the world, to inſtruct men in faith. Secondly, M. White granteth, that <hi>by this rule and meanes we may be infallibly inſtructed, what is to be holden for true faith.</hi> Thirdly he yeeldeth, that the <hi>onely cauſe, why a man miſſeth of the truth, is either becauſe he doth not finde the rule, or hauing found it, he will not obey it.</hi> Fourthly he ſaith, that <hi>the rule is left indifferently to all,</hi> in this ſenſe, that it is of ſuch nature, that it is <hi>able to direct any man, be he neuer ſo ſimple, and that the moſt vnlearned aliue, may vnderſtand and conceiue it ſufficiently for his ſaluation.</hi> Thus farre M. White granteth, and this is in a manner, as much as I need deſire to be granted, concerning the principall concluſion of this Chapter. For hence followeth <hi>firſt,</hi> that no man may preſume to attaine faith, without finding, and following ſome certaine, or ordinary rule, and meanes ordained by God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that no man, for want of learning, or by reaſon of his ſimplicity, &amp;c. neede to deſpaire, but that, by ſeeking, finding, &amp; following ſome certain rule, &amp; meanes appointed by God, be ſhall be ſufficiently inſtructed in faith. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that euery one, carefull of ſaluation may ſee; how much it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth to ſeeke, finde, and follow this <hi>rule,</hi> and <hi>meanes;</hi> as expecting by it, &amp; only by it (according to the ordinary courſe of Gods Prouidence) to be ſufficiently inſtructed, what is to be holden, for that one, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, entire, true faith, which is neceſſary to ſaluation.</q>

               <p n="1">1 MY aduerſaries fift concluſion was, that as <hi>one entire faith is neceſſary to ſaluation,</hi> ſo <hi>God, who willes the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of all men, hath prouided, and left an ordinary rule, and meanes, whereby they may be informed, which, and what this faith is.</hi> This concluſion he viſites, in this place, to ſee how his aduerſaries haue vſed it, and firſt he repeates it, then he telles his purpoſe in laying it downe: next he reports what I ſaid to it, though ſcarſe truly. Fourthly he telles what followes of that, which he findes I haue <hi>granted</hi> him; and ſo laſtly leaues the onely difficulty that I obiected againſt it vnaſſoiled, and leaps into a wilde-gooſe chaſe, nothing to the point, about <hi>Praedeſtination,</hi> whither M.

His <hi>purpoſe</hi> in propounding it, he ſaies was, <hi>firſt</hi> to admoniſh ſuch as preſume to attaine faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vſing the meanes: <hi>Secondly</hi> to helpe ſuch as deſpaire, when they either know not that there is ſuch a meanes, or vnderſtand not what in particular it is.

                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:20570:125"/> and <hi>desperation,</hi> he layes downe this concluſion, touching the rule of faith: the which when he afterward defines to be his <hi>Romane Church, ſpeaking by the mouth of the Pope,</hi> you may perceaue what a ready way he takes to keepe men from <hi>Preſumption,</hi> and <hi>Deſperation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 But whatſoeuer his intent were, he ſayes I grant him 4. things, <hi>which is in a manner, as much as he deſires.

                        <p>Secondly, whereas there are diuers expoſitions of theſe wordes of the Apoſtle giuen by good authors, the chiefe queſtion betwixt me and my aduerſaries is about the expoſition of S. Damaſcen, S. Thomas and many other learned Diuines, who hold that the Apoſtle, ſaying that <hi>God will all men to be ſaued,</hi> meaneth that God hath an <hi>Antecedent</hi> will to ſaue euery man, although, conſidering the ſinnes of men, he he hath a <hi>conſequent</hi> will to condemne ſome. This expoſition my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries miſlike, either in their ignorance, becauſe they do not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it aright, or for that they adhere to ſome part of Caluines er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror about Praedeſtination, with which it cannot ſtand. Wherefore to inſtruct their ignorance in this point, and to deliuer them, or at leaſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, from the poiſon of that moſt peſtilent opinion which Caluine holdeth concerning Praedeſtination, I will firſt declare the foreſaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, therewithall prouing it to be good, Secondly I wil relate Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines opinion about Praedeſtination, and will ſhew it to be erronious in it ſelfe, pernitious to men, and impious towards God. It ſeemeth that my aduerſaries, in their ignorance haue a ſtrange conceit of the <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi> will, by which, according to this expoſition, <hi>God will haue all men ſaued.</hi> For M.

For God</hi> ANTECEDENTLY <hi>of himſelfe, wils that all men ſhould be ſaued, and come to the knowledge of his truth; but when we ſinne, he will puniſh vs ſo much as he ſees expedient. And thus Gods</hi> ANTECEDENT <hi>will is of his goodneſſe, and his</hi> CONSE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QVENT <hi>will of his iuſtice.</hi> Theſe are the words of Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen, expounding the manner how God will haue all men to be ſaued, wherein he ſeemes to affirme fiue things tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the antecedent and conſequent will of God. Firſt that <hi>his Antecedent wil is that whereby he wils a thing ſimply of himſelfe, of his owne goodneſſe and nature, not moued thereunto by any thing in the creature, out of himſelfe.</hi> As when he wils the good and ſaluation of the elect. <hi>His conſequent will is that, when he wils according to the dispoſition, and nature or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the creature,</hi> as it deſerues for the manifeſtation of his iuſtice: as when he wils the puniſhment of him that ſins, becauſe in iuſtice ſinne deſerues puniſhment. Secondly, that <hi>Gods conſequent will followes vpon the condition of the creature, and vpon ſome cauſe therein going before:</hi> in which regard it is called conſequent; that is a will enſuing after: as when he wils the puniſhment of man, after that man hath ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Thirdly, that <hi>the antecedent will of God, is his good pleaſure, whereby he takes delight in that he wils:</hi> but <hi>his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent will, is his permiſſion, ſuffering iudgement to be inflicted on them that ſinne.</hi> Fourthly, that <hi>by this antecedent will, God
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:20570:131"/> would all men to be ſaued, and come to his kingdome; and by his conſequent will, ſuch to be puniſhed as ſinne againſt him.</hi> Fiftly, that <hi>God by his antecedent wil, decrees onely good things, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his goodneſſe:</hi> and by his conſequent will, onely euill things, according to his iuſtice, in that he made no man to puniſh him, but to participate his goodneſſe. From this ſence of Damaſcen thus explicated, I gather three things that enſue vpon it. Firſt, that by Damaſcens iudgement, the firſt roote of election ſhould be foreſeene merits; and the firſt roote of reprobation ſhould be the foreſight of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates ſinne: becauſe none is either ſaued or refuſed, but by a conſequent will; which will ariſes in God, from the cauſe in the creature. Secondly I gather, that what God wils not ſimply of himſelfe, without the condition of the creature, he wils not antecedently but conſequently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Gods antecedent will, is ſimple and independant: whereupon it
<note n="o" place="margin">Hence it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that this Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent will in God, is no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it works nothing.</note> followes, that albeit God by his antecedent will, would all men to be ſaued; yet no man is ſaued by it, foraſmuch as all men are ſaued conſequently vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their workes. Thirdly I gather, that God willing to ſaue all, by his antecedent will; and yet, <hi>de facto,</hi> ſauing none but by his conſequent will, ariſing from that which he ſees or foreſees in the creature, it followes that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of wils antecdent and conſequent, is not reall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe according to the one of them, God workes nothing. And this touching Damaſcens owne expoſition.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 Others expound the antecedent will, to be vpon the firſt conſideration of a thing; and the conſequent, vpon the latter conſideration, thus: as God conſiders man abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, abſtracting from euery thing that circumſtantially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs vnto him, and repreſenting him to himſelfe onely as a creature; he wils his good and ſaluation <hi>antecedently.</hi> But conſidering him againe, not onely according to his nature, but alſo as he is a ſinner, or a iuſt man, ſo he wils his ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or damnation <hi>conſequently,</hi> according to that he findes in him.

In this caſe it might tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaid, that the King would haue all his ſubiects liue; the true and proper meaning of which ſaying, were, that the King of his owne part had a will (to wit, an <hi>antecedent</hi> will) to ſaue euery ſubiect from death, although by a <hi>conſequent</hi> will, occaſioned by the offences of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, he decreed to put ſome to death.

In which caſe, the Kings will to ſaue the life of his ſubiects, were a true antecedent will: and though it were not his finall reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, yet were it formally and properly the Kings will and his determination; notwithſtanding, to put ſuch to death as breake his lawes, were his conſequent will, whereto hee were not naturally inclined, but occaſioned by the ill deſerts of his ſubiects: ſo is it in God, whoſe deſire that all men ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ariſing from his owne goodneſſe, is his primarie and antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent will, which is properly, formally, and in ſome ſence ſimply his will: but his purpoſe to condemne ſome, ariſing from his iuſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as deſerue it by their ſinnes, is his ſecondary and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent wil, not proceeding out of his owne naturall inclination, but the ill deſert of the wicked.</hi> In which example, he makes the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Gods predeſtination, and willing men, ſome to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſome to be condemned, to be this: that God in the firſt
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:20570:133"/> inſtant of his counſell, propounded equally to himſelfe Iacob and Eſau, the elect and the reprobate, and loued the one no more then the other, but had an equall will indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to ſaue them both; this is his antecedent will. In the ſecond inſtant, he wils and purpoſes to ſaue him of the two, that ſhall in his life time well deſerue it, and to damne him of the two that ſhall ſinne: this is his conſequent will. In neither of theſe two inſtances doth he yet make any diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene Iacob and Eſau, by either electing the one, or refuſing the other: but onely hath an intention and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall will to ſaue him that ſhall deſerue it. In the third in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, he decrees and wils to giue them both, though not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, yet ſufficient meanes of ſaluation, and helpes of grace, whereby Eſau may as well come to ſaluation as Iacob: and this not onely in Adam, but alſo in themſelues conſidered in the ſtate of ſinne. In the fourth inſtant, he decrees to leaue them both to the libertie and free choiſe of their owne will, to vſe theſe meanes of ſaluation, or not to vſe them, Iacob as well as Eſau, the elect as well as the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.

<note n="h" place="margin">Pag. 166.</note> writes, how <hi>God vpon the foreſight and respect of mens liuing and dying well, in the ſecret chamber of his diuine knowledge and will, pronounces a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſentence and decree of ſaluation to ſome, and of damnation to others.</hi> Which alſo is the doctrine whereinto this expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Gods antecedent and conſequent will is reſolued. Againe, if God predeſtinate no man to his end, but vpon the foreſight and reſpect of his workes, then he hath no perfect or formall will to elect any, but after the foreſight of his good life; nor to reprobate any, but after the foreſight of his euill life: which being ſo, I demaund whence it comes that the elect beleeue, and the reprobate beleeue not; and how it comes to paſſe, that God foreſees grace in the one, and ſinne in the other? It muſt needs be anſwered, either that it is Gods will the elect ſhall haue grace, and the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate no grace giuen them; or that they beleeue, or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, of their owne free will, by the ſtrength of nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any working of God. This latter is groſſe Pelagianiſme, making nature the beginning of grace. But if the former be granted, that God foreſees no grace but what himſelfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinates to giue; nor no ſinne but what vpon the withhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:20570:135"/> of his grace, the reprobate will freely worke; then, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all diſcourſe, this makes that the cauſe of predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is an effect enſuing on it: for therefore God will and doth giue grace, becauſe firſt he hath elected; and will giue no grace, becauſe he hath reprobated, as I will ſhew by and by.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 Secondly, it is a ground both in Diuinitie and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the will intends the end before the meanes: hence it followes, that God cannot haue this conſequent will, to ſaue vpon the foreſight of grace. For I reaſon thus:

And ſo vpon this foreſight and reſpect of mens liuing and dying well or ill, pronounces the ſentence of ſaluation and damnation.</hi> Againſt this I reaſon thus. He that neither elects nor repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates any, vpon the foreſight of their good or ill vſing of grace and meanes offered, by their owne freewill; hath no ſuch antecedent will to ſaue all, nor conſequent will, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate any, onely vpon the foreſight of their ſin: This is plaine: becauſe this antecedent and conſequent will is defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by willing and not willing, vpon foreſight of that which man, by his freewill, will do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if the definition be not in God, then neither is the thing defined.

Ergo God hath no ſuch antecedent will to ſaue all, nor conſequent will to reprobate any vpon the condition of their workes; The ſecond propoſition I proue by reaſon and authoritie. By reaſon: for whatſoeuer he foreſaw in any, that himſelfe purpoſed to worke. If he foreſaw grace and the good vſe of freewill in Iacob, he purpoſed to worke it by infuſing it: if he foreſaw ſin and the ill vſe of freewill in Eſaw, he purpoſed

Firſt, by flowing and concurring onely into the effect, and ſo producing it equally with the ſecond cauſe. As when two men equally carry a blocke betweene them, the one holding it at the one end, and the other bearing at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: where one of the men is not mooued or ſtirred by the other, but both together make one cauſe equally producing the effect, which is, the moouing of the wood. Thus God concurs not with our will. Secondly by moouing our will it ſelfe and touching it, by his effectuall power, whereby it is determined and applied to the effect, as in a clocke we ſee one wheele to moue another. Now my propoſition is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Gods moouing our will in this latter manner. Note ſecondly, that God againe may be ſuppoſed, in this latter ſort, to determine our will 2. waies. The firſt is by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining, and violent inforcing it; as when a man throwes a ſtone, or ſhoots an arrow; and thus he mooues vs not.

                  <q>A. D.
<note place="margin">Pag. 173</note> Concerning the ſixt Chapter — hauing ſhewed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter, that Almighty God, of his part, hath prouided a <hi>meanes</hi> neceſſary, and ſufficient to the ſaluation of <hi>all</hi> ſorts, yea of <hi>all</hi> men, and conſequently, that he hath prouided ſome <hi>rule,</hi> and <hi>meanes</hi> ſufficient to inſtruct men of all ſorts, in that one, <hi>infallible, entire</hi> faith, which is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to ſaluation: In this Chapter I did ſet downe certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of this rule, and meanes by which men that ſeeke, may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, towards the finding of it. My Aduerſaries do not deny, that the <hi>rule,</hi> and <hi>meanes</hi> muſt in ſome ſence, haue theſe three properties, which here I ſpeake of. For the firſt, to wit, <hi>infallibility,</hi> M. White ſaith,
<note place="margin">White pag. 10.</note> that <hi>faith muſt be with full aſſurance and perſwaſion, the which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we cannot obtaine, vnleſſe the rule giue it vs.</hi> Now it is certaine, that the rule, and meanes, which here I ſpeake of, cannot giue infallible aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, if it ſelfe were not infallible, and knowne, or ſuch as may bee knowne to be infallible. For nothing can giue more, then it ſelfe hath: neither can it breed more certainety in our knowledge, then it ſelfe is, or may be, knowne to haue. For the ſecond, to wit, <hi>eaſineſſe</hi> to be knowne, or vnderſtood of all ſorts, M. Wootton interpreteth,
<note place="margin">Wootton p. 74.</note> that it muſt be ſuch, as <hi>may be</hi> knowne, although with paines. As for ſome paines, I ſhall not gaineſay. For I did neuer dreame that one might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge of matters of faith, by <hi>onely dreaming,</hi> as M. Woot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſeemeth to interprete my meaning. Onely I would not haue it ſo difficult, or hard, as that it ſhould be morally impoſſible for any ſort of men, hauing ſought, found, and attended to the rule, and meanes (without miraculous illumination, or extraordinary, and exceſſiue dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty) to vnderſtand the determinate meaning of it: In which M. White ſeemeth to yeeld me, for he ſaith, that <hi>the rule muſt be eaſie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">White pag. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:20570:144"/> plaine to all ſorts of men, learned, and vnlearned,</hi> to wit, <hi>which vſe the meanes, and are diligent in attending to it; and be enlightened with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God: to all ſuch</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is plaine be they neuer ſo vnlearned, to the reſt it is not. Neither is it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a neceſſary condition of the rule ſo to be: not becauſe it is obſcure at any time, but for that ſometimes men haue not eyes to ſee into it, &amp;c.</hi> This which he hath ſaid, of being <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened</hi> with the ſpirit, had need to be declared. If he meane, that one muſt be <hi>first endued with faith,</hi> and in that ſence lightned with the Spirit, before he can vnderſtand the determinate ſence, and meaning of that, which is appointed by God to be the ordinary rule, and meanes, to inſtruct men in faith; then it is falſe, that <hi>to be enlightened</hi> with the Spirit, is required as a neceſſary condition; for ſo one muſt be ſuppoſed to haue faith, before he can by the ordinary meanes be firſt inſtructed in faith: &amp; ſo the ordinary meanes were needleſſe, for the end to which it was appointed. For what need were there of an <hi>outward ordinary meanes,</hi> to inſtruct men firſt in faith, when they are already ſuppoſed to be, by the ſpirit, ſufficiently enlightned with faith? If he meane one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>that the Spirit of God, muſt aſſist, and concur with mans vnderſtanding, in a ſpeciall manner</hi> to enable the vnderſtanding to apprehend the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction propounded by the meanes, and to make it yeeld aſſent of faith, ſo I ſhall not ſtriue with him, as hauing in
<note n="*" place="margin">Introd. q. 6.</note> the Introduction af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed as much. Onely I would haue him note, FIRST, that it is not <hi>the Protestants ſpirit,</hi> whoſe illumination is required to true faith, as
<note n="o" place="margin">Ibid.</note> there I haue ſhewed. SECONDLY, that the true Spirit of God, whoſe aſſiſtance is neceſſary, is ready (through the merits of our Sauiour Chriſt) to aſſiſt all men ſufficiently, to the attaining of the truth: and that no man (who hath receiued <hi>exciting</hi> grace to moue him to ſeeke, find, and attend vnto the ordinary rule, and meanes appointed by God for mens inſtruction, in matters of faith) need feare want of neceſſary aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, to concurre with him, but rather had need to feare, leaſt himſelfe be wanting to the gracious aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, in being negligent to concurre with it, ſo much as he may, and ought: and leaſt in ſteed of following Gods Spirit, he ſuffers himſelfe to be miſled with the ſpirit of Sathan, transfiguring himſelfe into an <hi>Angell of light,</hi> whoſe propertie is to withdraw men from the ſecure ordinary meanes of the doctrine of the Church, to follow priuate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts, ſo coloured with ſeeming ſentences of Scripture, as though they were the very inſtincts of the holy Ghoſt. The third propertie, to wit, <hi>vniuerſality,</hi> is meant, that the rule, and meanes doth extend it ſelfe to all points of faith; ſo far as it is, or may be, neceſſary to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In which ſence I do not perceiue my Aduerſaries to gaineſay. Onely the queſtion is, WHETHER <hi>and</hi> HOW <hi>all points of faith be neceſſary to ſaluation?</hi> The which queſtion, I haue reſolued in the Introduction, and in the fourth Chapter, where I do determine all points of faith to be neceſſary to be beleeued, <hi>explicitè,</hi> or <hi>implicitè,</hi> of all ſorts: and that
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:20570:144"/> none is indifferent, or ſuch as may be lawfully <hi>misbeleeued</hi> (eſpecially obſtinately) at any time, by any perſons; and that although all be not neceſſary to be knowne, at all times, <hi>expreſly</hi> by all perſons: yet they are, or may be neceſſary, ſo to be knowne, at leaſt at ſometimes, and by ſome perſons, in the Church; and conſequently there muſt be an <hi>vniuerſall, ordinary rule,</hi> and <hi>meanes, ſufficient</hi> to inſtruct, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue all ſorts of men, in all points of faith, <hi>at ſuch times,</hi> and <hi>in ſuch ſort,</hi> as need ſhall require, thereby to hinder men from misbeleeuing any: and which may tell them determinately (when controuerſies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe) whether this, or that point be neceſſary to be knowne, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued expreſly, by <hi>all,</hi> or onely <hi>ſome</hi> of the Church, and by <hi>whom.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe three properties of the rule, and meanes.
<note place="margin">White pag. 10.</note> M. White would haue other two. But either they are not neceſſary; or elſe they be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently included in theſe, which I haue ſet downe. For if the rule bee knowne to be <hi>infallible,</hi> it little skilleth to our preſent purpoſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any <hi>higher rule,</hi> whereupon it doth depend, or no, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the caſe, which is to be ruled by it, concerne the thing it ſelfe, which is aſſigned for the rule, or ſome other thing: for where <hi>infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> is, <hi>partiality</hi> need not be feared: neither need one ſeeke <hi>a higher rule,</hi> when he knoweth the rule, which he hath, to be <hi>infallible.</hi>

               <p n="1">1 MY Aduerſaries laſt concluſion was, that <hi>the rule of faith muſt haue three properties.</hi> 1 <hi>To be infallible, that ſhall not deceiue vs.</hi> 2 <hi>Eaſie to be vnderſtood of all ſorts of men, learned, and vnlearned.</hi> 3 <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niuerſall, to ſhew what is the truth in all points.</hi> Touching my anſwer hereto, he ſayes foure thing. FIRST, that I grant theſe three properties to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Rule <hi>in ſome ſence.</hi> The <hi>firſt,</hi> that it muſt be infallible; and <hi>the laſt</hi> that it muſt be vniuerſall, I grant ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply without any limitation, and this is true. SECOND<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY, touching the ſecond condition, of being <hi>eaſie,</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds himſelfe, that he meanes ſo eaſie, that <hi>without mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous illumination, or extraordinary, and exceſſiue difficulty, any ſort of men may vnderſtand the meaning of it,</hi> and ſayes <hi>M. White ſeemes alſo to yeeld</hi> him <hi>this.</hi> The which I did in theſe words: <hi>The rule is eaſie, and plaine to all ſorts of men, learned, and vnlearned, that vſe the meanes, and are diligent in attending it, and be inlightned by the Spirit of God, to ſuch it is plaine, be they neuer ſo vnlearned: to the reſt it is not: nether is it a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:20570:145"/> of the rule ſo to be: not becauſe it ſelfe is obſcure at any time, but for that ſometimes men haue not eyes</hi> (for want of diligence, or Gods illumination) <hi>to ſee into it; for all meanes, and rules are vaine vnles God giue eyes to ſee.</hi> This expoſition wherby I decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in what ſence the rule muſt be vnderſtood to be eaſie, he diſtinguiſhes: and ſayes, If I meane <hi>no more but that the Spirit of God muſt helpe our vnderſtanding, in a ſpeciall manner, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it to apprehend, and yeeld to that, which the rule propounds:</hi> he will not contend with me. But if my meaning be, that <hi>a man muſt firſt haue faith, and in that ſence be inlightned, before he can vnderſtand the meaning of the rule;</hi> then he ſayes my ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is falſe; and ſets downe a propoſition againſt it; that <hi>to be endued with faith, is not required as a neceſſary condition to the eaſines of the rule:</hi> which is a needleſſe limitation. For firſt, I mentioned not <hi>faith,</hi> but the <hi>illumination of Gods Spirit,</hi> whereof faith is an effect. 2. Himſelfe in thoſe words, <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God muſt aſſiſt, and concur with mans vnderſtanding,</hi> not onely in generall to preſerue the faculty thereof, but in <hi>a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner to enable it to apprehend, and yeeld:</hi> confeſſes as much, as I ſaid, or could meane, taking my words in all their latitude. 3. If faith be taken in one particular ſence, as ſometimes it is for <hi>the receiuing of diuine illumination into the heart,</hi> as a darke roome, when the window is opened, or a candle is brought in, receiues light: then it is true,

Therefore as he that ſeekes a thing in a blind roome, firſt opens the window, and lets in light, and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies his eye, with the helpe of that meanes to the obiect: ſo though it be ſuppoſed, that <hi>faith cannot be had before the rule inſtruct vs,</hi> yet this light of Gods Spirit, which is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of faith, as the <hi>medium</hi> whereby the rule is vnderſtood, goes in order before it.

               <p n="2">2 Thirdly touching <hi>illumination</hi> of the Spirit, which we both agree is neceſſary for the vſing, and vnderſtanding of the Rule, he will haue 2. things noted. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that this is not the <hi>Proteſtants ſpirit.</hi> Whereunto I anſwer, it is neither the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> nor <hi>Romiſh,</hi> nor any <hi>priuate</hi> ſpirit, much leſſe the Popes ſpirit;
<note n="a" place="margin">Shewed Ch. 35.</note> whereby alone they breathe, that thus charge others with <hi>priuate spirits;</hi> but the Spirit of God, that is
<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.6.</note> 
                  <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen to euery man to profit withal. Secondly</hi> that this Spirit of God is <hi>ready to aſſiſt all men, at leaſt ſufficiently to the attaining of the truth and that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grace hath excited to vſe the rule, need feare any want thereof: but all men rather had need feare leaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues be wanting to concurre with this Spirit; and leaſt in ſtead of following the Spirit of God, they ſuffer themſelues</hi> (as all they do, that follow the Church of Rome) <hi>to be miſled by the ſpirit of Satan, transfiguring himſelfe into an Angell of light, &amp;c.</hi> The which I am alſo well pleaſed to note: and commend backe againe to himſelfe, and all of his ſect, who refuſing the light of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> that ſo euidently detects their errors, haue ſuffered themſelues to be ſeduced by the ſpirit of <hi>Antichriſt</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 13.13.</note>
, who hath transfigured himſelfe into <hi>an Angell of light:</hi> and broaching his owne <hi>priuate</hi> conceits, yet colours all with the ſtile of S. <hi>Peters ſucceſſour,</hi> and ſeeming <hi>authority,</hi> and <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the Church: when the <hi>Primum mobile</hi> of all Papiſtry is now become the Ieſuited Popes ſole inſtinct.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Fourthly he miſlikes, that beſides theſe 3. properties of the Rule, I would haue other two: <hi>Vnpartiality,</hi> that it be addicted to no ſide: and <hi>Authority</hi> to conuince, that there might be no appeale from it. But theſe conditions I added for the better explication of the reſt, and to exclude the Church of Rome, which is ſo <hi>partiall,</hi> that it begges to be it owne iudge; and ſo <hi>vnable</hi> to ſupport the cauſe, ſince that the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt definitions thereof are ſtill called in queſtion by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: as

                  <hi>theſe conditions are either not neceſſary, or elſe included in the other</hi> 3. the former of which is not true: the latter, that they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the condition of infallibleneſſe, I will not contend about: onely I noted them for the more diſtinct, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar explication of that which muſt belong to the Rule.

                     <note place="margin">Pag. 177.</note> A. D. Concerning the ſeuenth Chapter — if my aduerſaries did not ignorantly or wilfully, peruert the ſtate of the queſtion, they could not haue had colour, to make ſo long diſcourſe, about this Chapter as they do both make. My queſtion was not, <hi>whether Scripture be the rule of faith,</hi> but whether it <hi>alone,</hi> be the rule, and meanes ordained by God to <hi>breed</hi> in men, that one, infallible, entire Faith, which is neceſſary to ſaluation. This my queſtion my aduerſaries peruert, FIRST in that they would gladly (as it ſeemeth) make men beleeue, that we exclude Scripture, from being <hi>in any ſort,</hi> the rule of faith, and thereupon
<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 10 11.</note> M. Wootton maketh ſpeciall oppoſition betwixt the Scripture, which they aſſigne, and the doctrine of the Church, which we aſſigne for the rule of faith: whereas we make no ſuch oppoſition at all, but hold the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>(as propounded to vs by the Church)</hi> to be part of that, which in the tenth Chapter I call <hi>the rule of faith.</hi> For by <hi>the doctrine of the Church,</hi> which there I cal the rule of faith, I do not meane any <hi>humane</hi> doctrine; as <hi>humane</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Diuine;</hi> but do account the ſame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whether <hi>written,</hi> or <hi>vnwritten</hi> (which is called diuine, becauſe it was firſt immediatly reuealed by God to the Prophets, and Apoſtles) to be alſo <hi>Church doctrine;</hi> becauſe it is propounded, interpreted, and applyed in particular to vs, by the Paſtours of the Church. This my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary might haue vnderſtood euen by the very title of this Chapter, in regard I ſaid not, <hi>the Scripture is not the rule</hi> of faith, but <hi>Scripture</hi> ALONE <hi>is not the rule</hi> of faith SECONDLY they peruert the ſtate of the queſtion, in that they take <hi>the rule</hi> of faith otherwiſe, then I do, and otherwiſe then according to the drift of the precedent Chapters (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:20570:146"/> this preſent Chapter doth depend) they ought to do. For whereas there may be diſtinguiſhed in this matter: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that which is <hi>a rule</hi> of faith, but not the ordinary ſufficient meanes, ordained by God <hi>to breed faith</hi> in men: viz: the diuine reuealed verities, as they are in themſelues: Secondly that which is <hi>ſo</hi> an infallible rule of faith, as it is alſo the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſufficient meanes ordained by God to <hi>breed faith</hi> in men: My ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaryes for their better aduantage take the queſtion in the firſt ſenſe, whereas they ought to take it in the ſecond ſenſe, in regard I ſo take it in the fift Chapter, vnto which this Chapter hath reference. For whereas in the foure firſt Chapters, I had ſet downe, for a certaine ground, that <hi>one infallible, entire faith,</hi> was <hi>neceſſary to ſaluation;</hi> in the firſt Chapter I proued that <hi>God had ordained ſome rule,</hi> and <hi>meanes,</hi> that is, ſome <hi>ſuch</hi> rule as was, <hi>alſo a meanes, ſufficient to breed</hi> this one, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, entire faith in all ſorts of men, yea, <hi>quantum ex ſe,</hi> in all men: In the ſixt Chapter I ſet downe certaine <hi>conditions</hi> of this rule, and meanes: and conſequently, when in this ſeuenth Chapter, I deny <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone to be the rule,</hi> I muſt needes meane that <hi>it is not the rule, which is alſo a ſufficient ordinary meanes,</hi> of which all my ſpeech went before. Now in this true ſenſe my aduerſaries do not gaineſay, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted by the euidence of truth, yeeld that Scripture <hi>alone</hi> is not the rule, taking the rule as it ſignifieth that, which is <hi>ſo</hi> a rule, as it is alſo the ordinary ſufficient <hi>meanes to breed faith</hi> in men, as here I take it. <hi>The Scripture it ſelfe</hi> (ſaith M.

                  <hi>into the Engliſh tongue, cannot he this rule.</hi> This I denied in another concluſion oppoſite to it, vſing the words of the publike articles of our Church: <hi>The Scripture, comprehended in the Canonicall bookes of the old and new Teſtament, is the rule of faith, ſo far that whatſoeuer is not read therein, or cannot be proued thereby, is not to be accepted as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny point of faith,</hi> or needfull to be followed. And ſo, from that place to pag. 57, I diſputed that <hi>the Scripture</hi> ALONE <hi>is the rule of faith:</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>That rule</hi> which my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary, in his fourth ground, had ſaid, <hi>God had prouided, whereby euery man, learned and vnlearned, may ſufficiently be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed</hi> WHAT <hi>is to be holden for the true faith.</hi> Now he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines that <hi>the State is peruerted,</hi> the queſtion not being <hi>whether Scripture be the rule of faith:</hi> but <hi>whether Scripture</hi> alone <hi>be the rule and</hi> meane, <hi>ordained of God to</hi> breed <hi>all faith.</hi> And he notes two points wherein it is peruerted.

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:20570:148"/> 
                  <hi>as propounded by the Church,</hi> to be <hi>part</hi> of it. I anſwer, that I knew well enough they confeſſed the Scripture to be <hi>part</hi> of the rule, and the Diuine doctrine, which is the whole rule, to be, <hi>ſome of it,</hi> written. But I knew alſo that they denied it to be <hi>the whole</hi> rule: ioyning therewith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written <hi>traditions</hi> and the Popes <hi>Decretals,</hi> which they call <hi>Church authority:</hi> I knew alſo they allowed it to be no part of the rule but <hi>as,</hi> and <hi>in ſuch ſence, as</hi> the Church of Rome ſhould pleaſe to propound it: and I ſaw his concluſion, in termes, denying the Scripture <hi>alone</hi> to be the rule whereby men may ſufficiently be inſtructed WHAT the faith is: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I diſputed directly oppoſite to all this, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone, without <hi>traditions,</hi> is the whole rule to ſhew vs WHAT is to be holden for faith; and nothing but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this is cloſe to the queſtion. For albeit he yeelds it to be the rule <hi>in a ſort,</hi> becauſe <hi>as his Church propounds it,</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines <hi>part</hi> of the rule; yet he denies it to be that <hi>whole and entire rule,</hi> that his concluſion inquires of: and ſo is to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted againſt as well as if he denied it to be any part of the rule at all. Againe, he holds two things. Firſt affirmatiuely; that <hi>the Scripture is one part of the rule:</hi> then negatiuely: that <hi>the Scripture alone is not all the rule.</hi> Both theſe are contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to my aſſertion: <hi>The Scripture alone is the rule.</hi> My aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion therefore affirming what he denies, and denying what he affirmes, containes the true ſtate of the queſtion: and his inuoluing the matter with all this cauilling, tends onely to the couering of his doctrine, the loathſome viſage whereof he is aſhamed ſhould be ſeene.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The ſecond point wherein he ſayes <hi>the queſtion is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted,</hi> is in that I take <hi>the rule</hi> of faith <hi>otherwiſe</hi> then he doth. For whereas he, by that word <hi>rule,</hi> meanes <hi>ſuch a rule as not onely is ſufficient to</hi> REVEALE, <hi>all diuine truths that are to be beleeued, but alſo to</hi> BREED, <hi>or produce in vs, the faith whereby we beleeue them:</hi> I, he ſayes, vnderſtand ſuch a rule onely as is <hi>ſufficient to</hi> reueale <hi>the diuine verities, though it be not ſufficient to</hi> breed <hi>in vs</hi> faith <hi>and</hi> aſſent <hi>thereunto.</hi> And it is true that I vnderſtand ſuch a rule indeed; the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

And that my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary holds the ſame thing, I will prone directly. For ha-laid downe 4. grounds: Firſt, that <hi>true faith is neceſſary:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that <hi>this faith is onely one:</hi> Thirdly, that <hi>this faith muſt be certaine:</hi> Fourthly, <hi>and entire in all points:</hi> he addes the fift, that <hi>it muſt not be doubted, but God hath prouided, and left ſome certaine rule, and meanes, whereby euery man may, in all points, and queſtions, be ſufficiently, and infallibly inſtructed,</hi> WHAT <hi>is to be holden for true faith:</hi> and then immediately, he puts the queſtion, <hi>what in particular may be aſſigned to be this rule?</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he anſwers, in his firſt concluſion: <hi>The Scripture alone, eſpecially as tranſlated into Engliſh, cannot be this rule.</hi> Which I denied. Therefore his queſtion was touching the ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Scripture, as the ſaid ſufficiency is oppoſed to <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> &amp; not as it is diſtinguiſhed againſt <hi>the requiſite condition of the meanes</hi> to be vſed for the vnderſtanding of the Scripture. And this I confirme: for my aduerſary ſaies, they hold the Scripture to be <hi>part of the rule,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>part of the doctrine of the Church immediatly reuealed by God:</hi> but <hi>yet there are many ſubſtantiall points of faith not contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them.</hi> Yea

               <p n="4">4 Neuertheleſſe, pleaſing himſelfe with his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, he concludes, that <hi>conuicted with the euidence of truth,</hi> I haue <hi>yeelded to his concluſion,</hi> in that ſence wherein he meant it, <hi>That Scripture alone is not the rule of faith.</hi> And therefore all my <hi>diſcourſe is idle and impertinent.</hi> I anſwer two things, firſt, if his concluſion, <hi>The Scripture alone is not this rule,</hi> which almighty God hath prouided <hi>whereby euery man may ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be inſtructed</hi> WHAT <hi>is to be holden for true faith;</hi> meane no more but onely to adde the Miniſtry of the Church, and mens owne induſtry, to the Scripture, as the meanes, for the ordinary vnderſtanding and beleeuing that which is written in it: in this ſence, the Scripture alone is the rule whereby to iudge <hi>whatſoeuer matter</hi> belongs to faith; but Scripture alone is not the ordinary rule and meanes, by it ſelfe, to kindle in vs the true knowledge and faith of that which it containes, <hi>without the Miniſtrie of the Church, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things,</hi> be ioyned with it, for the learning of it: then I grant it: and require the Ieſuite againe in lieu thereof, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to renounce his traditions, or elſe confeſſe they haue no other vſe but onely to helpe to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and teach that which is <hi>wholly</hi> contained in the Scripture, without any power to <hi>ſupply</hi> any defect of doctrine that may be ſuppoſed to be therein. And when he hath done, the next treatiſe of faith he writes, to diſtinguiſh a little better betweene the <hi>Rule,</hi> and the <hi>Meanes</hi> of applying it: and not ſay, that is no ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent rule whereby to be inſtructed WHAT is faith and WHAT not, which onely is not a ſufficient meanes to bring men to faith without the ſubordinate condition of ſuch meanes as is required in the application of any rule. Secondly I anſwer, that his concluſion meanes more: viz. That Scripture alone
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:20570:150"/> is vnperfect and defectiue 2. waies. The firſt, in that, without other meanes, it doth not ordinarily breed, or draw foorth, in vs, aſſent to that it reueales, nor ſo much as make vs ſee the reuelation to be. And therefore there needes the Church, by her Paſtor, to teach and perſwade vs: and there needes the Spirit of God, and induſtrie, in our ſelues. This way no Proteſtant euer denied. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, in that it alone containes not <hi>all</hi> Gods word, or <hi>all</hi> ſuch truth as he hath reuealed neceſſarily to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; but onely <hi>one ſmall and obſcure part thereof:</hi> the beſt part, or, at leaſt, ſome part, being by Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely, vnwritten. This way we deny with open mouth: and the Ieſuite holds it, and in the place now contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, hugges it in his armes: and therefore I diſcourſed againſt him as I did, and in no other ſenſe: and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it is apparant I yeelded not his concluſion, in the whole ſence, but onely in a part. For view my words: <hi>The Miniſterie of the Church is the ordinary meanes whereby we may learne the faith of Chriſt.</hi> And, <hi>no man can of himſelfe attaine to the knowledge thereof, but as the Church teaches him, except it be in ſome extraordinary caſes.</hi> How will my Ieſuite <hi>conclude</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence that therefore I <hi>yeeld his concluſion</hi> as it is vnderſtood the ſecond way, which way I haue ſhewed immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both his Church and himſelfe vnderſtand it?

No man will ſay ſo: when all men ſee the Magiſtrate to be but the executioner, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the law, to teach, publiſh, and execute that which is in the law it ſelfe: and the Booke of the law to containe the whole and entire obiect of obedience; that no ſubiect is bound to any obedience, or to the doing of any thing
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:20570:151"/> whatſoeuer the Magiſtrate might happen to impoſe vpon him, but that onely which is contained in the law; either expreſſely, or thence to be gathered by true conſequence.

                     <note place="margin">Pag. 179.</note> A. D. §. 1. That Engliſh tranſlations of Scripture are not infallible —concerning my firſt reaſon, it is to be obſerued, that I do not deny the <hi>true</hi> Scriptures, either in the originall, or in the tranſlation, to be infallible: but onely I proue the <hi>ordinary Engliſh tranſlations</hi> (which ordinarily Proteſtants call the Scriptures) not to be infallible; nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to be,
<note place="margin">Wootton pag. 68.</note> as ſome make them, <hi>the onely ſufficient rule, and means,</hi> to breed faith. M. Wootton asketh, <hi>what Engliſh Proteſtant euer affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that they were infallible, or tooke them for the rule?</hi> To this I reply, firſt, that I could wiſh theſe his queſtions could not be anſwered, with affirming, that many thouſand poore ſoules, that haue, and can onely reade Engliſh Bibles, think the texts which they reade in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be Gods word; and conſequently the infallible truth, and ſo take them for a rule
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:20570:151"/> of their faith, that <hi>wbat they finde written there, they moſt firmly beleeue; what they finde not there, they will not beleeue.</hi> Secondly, if the Engliſh tranſlation be not accounted <hi>infallible,</hi> nor <hi>the rule</hi> of faith, by ſome Proteſtants: I aske firſt, what M. White meaneth to ſay,
<note place="margin">White, pag. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>the Scripture tranſlated into Engliſh, is infallibly true in reſpect of the matter?</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I aske, what infallible rule and meanes haue at leaſt vnlearned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, whereupon to build their faith? It cannot be ſaid, that <hi>the truth of the reuealed doctrine</hi> in it ſelfe is their rule. For this is the thing that ſhould be beleeued, and is not the rule and meanes whereby men are to be directed to attain beliefe. The firſt <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Greeke originall text</hi> immediatly written by the holy writers, cannot be their rule. For firſt, where is this to be found? or how ſhall they be ſure, if they find it, that it is the very authenticall or originall, and not a tranſumpt? Or if a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may alſo ſerue, ſo that it be incorrupt, how ſhall they know infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly (ſecluding Church-authoritie) that that copie which they haue, is incorrupt, when they neuer ſaw the firſt authenticall: nor euer did, or are able to compare them together? Finally ſuppoſe they had a copie well agreeing with the originall; what nearer were they attaining faith by it, ſince they cannot vnderſtand it?
<note place="margin">White, pag. 25.</note> M White is ſo farre from diſclaiming from Engliſh tranſlations (as M. Wotton doth) that he will needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them to be <hi>infallible, in the matter contained in them:</hi> in ſo much, that with a bold brazen face, he ſaith, <hi>Martin cannot giue one inſtance of the ſence corrupted.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 26.</note> And although he ſeeme to leaue himſelfe a ſtarting hole, by ſaying that he doth not defend <hi>tbis or that mans edition,</hi> but <hi>the Scriptures wel and faithfully tranſlated;</hi> accounting it ſufficient that there be <hi>ſome</hi> tranſlations faithfull, and agreeing with the originall in the Church:
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> yet preſently after he taketh vpon him to defend the varieties of tranſlations, ſaying, that <hi>this varietie hath bene in words and ſtile, and not in any materiall point of the ſence.</hi> Now how falſe this bold and blind anſwer is, the Reader may eaſily perceiue if he will reade not onely M. Gregory Martins diſcouerie, but alſo M. Reynolds refutation of M. Whitaker, and the Grounds of the new Religion: which bookes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are, or can ſo be anſwered by M. Fulke, and his fellow Proteſtants to helpe him, but ſtill it wil be iuſtified and made plaine, that not onely one, but many inſtances may be giuen of the ſence corrupted. The which is not onely proued by our Diuines, but alſo confeſſed by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants themſelues. One of which ſaid,
<note place="margin">Broughtons epiſtle to the Lords of the Councell. Carlile in his booke, that Chriſt went not downe into hell.</note> that <hi>the Engliſh Bible was full of errors.</hi> And what errors? Onely in ſtile, or words? Nay, M. Carlile ſaith, that <hi>our Engliſh</hi> (Tranſlators) <hi>in many places detort the Scriptures from the right ſence;</hi> and that <hi>they haue corrupted and depraued the ſence, obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the truth, deceiued the ignorant.</hi> Which their confeſſion, if it were not alſo acknowledged for truth by others, what need were there, after ſo many varieties of tranſlations, that (with ſo much coſt, care, and ſcandal to the Proteſtant cauſe) they muſt needs haue order, by publik authority to coine a new tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Bible, different fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all Engliſh tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:20570:152"/> that haue bin before? the which alſo, when it cometh forth, will not be of infallible authoritie more then the former: neither can at leaſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned men be infallibly aſſured that it containeth no materiall error. For I would faine know, how they (who neither haue the authenticall originall, or if they had, cannot reade, and much leſſe vnderſtand, and compare the tranſlation with it; neither do admit infallible authoritie in the Church to aſſure them) can be infallibly aſſured that the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth not containe any ſubſtantiall error? To this M. White anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
<note place="margin">White, pag. 25.</note> that <hi>we know this by the ſame infallible meanes wherby we know other articles of beliefe:</hi> namely by <hi>the light of the doctrine tranſlated, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Spirit, the miniſtery of the word, the rules of are, the knowledge of tongues,</hi> and ſuch like. Here is a faire flouriſh of words: but anſwer me (good M. White) directly to the point. Are all of theſe <hi>ioyntly,</hi> or euery one <hi>ſeuerally,</hi> or <hi>onely ſome</hi> of theſe neceſſary, &amp; ſufficient to breed in vs infallible aſſurance of an article of faith? <hi>All</hi> are not neceſſary. For elſe how ſhall poore vnlearned men do, who want rules of art, knowledge of tongues, and ſuch like? <hi>Euery one</hi> ſeuerally is not ſufficient. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge of tongues, rules of art, nor the Proteſtant miniſtery, are of themſelues infallible, and conſequently cannot be of themſelues ſufficient to breed ſuch infallible aſſurance in vs, as is requiſite in an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of faith. Well then it remaineth, that <hi>onely ſome</hi> of theſe (to wit, the light of doctrine tranſlated, and the teſtimonie of the Spirit) are (euen according to the ordinary courſe) the only neceſſary, and of themſelues the ſole ſufficient meanes to breed this aſſurance: but this not. For then it wold follow, that euery one, learned and vnlearned, that had the Spirit of God, by the onely light of the doctrine it ſelf, without any other help, ſhould infallibly vnderſtand the Greeke and Hebrew text, either read by themſelues, or pronounced by a Miniſter; which is moſt falſe: and yet that it followeth wel, is apparent, becauſe true doctrine ſhineth, as wel, yea better (if M. White ſay true) in the Originall,
<note place="margin">White, pag. 26.</note> then in the Engliſh Tranſlations. <hi>We</hi> (ſaith M. White) <hi>know the diuine doctrine to be one and the ſame,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>immediatly in the Originall, more obſcurely in the Tranſlations:</hi> and, <hi>God</hi> (as the ſame M. White ſaith) <hi>directeth the children of light, by the holy Ghoſt, who openeth their hearts that they know his voice from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:</hi> and that <hi>the light of his truth may ſhine vnto them.</hi> Now if the light of the diuine doctrine do ſhine, <hi>as well,</hi> and <hi>better</hi> in the Hebrew and Greeke text, then in the Engliſh tranſlations; and that all which be chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light, haue the eies of their heart ſo opened, as they can diſcerne Gods voice fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all others: and that the light of his truth ſhineth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; what need is there then of any other, either priuate or publick meanes, to open their eies to ſee this light, when the holy Ghoſt doth ſufficiently open them? Or if he ſay, the holy Ghoſt doth not open them ſufficiently <hi>without oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

This my anſwer, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſuch a kind of erroniouſnes <hi>in words,</hi> my aduerſary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to M.

White anſwers, that his meaning in ſo ſaying, was to accord with M. Wotton, by diſtinguiſhing betweene the <hi>words</hi> and the <hi>contents</hi> of the tranſlations: M. Wotton denying the <hi>words</hi> to be the rule; and I affirming the <hi>matter contained</hi> in the words ſo to be.

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:20570:153"/> to error in <hi>one ſence;</hi> and I deny them to be ſubiect in <hi>another?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 This my aſſertion, that <hi>our Engliſh tranſlations, as touching the matter contained in them, are infallible:</hi> howſoeuer there be <hi>varietie</hi> among them in <hi>words</hi> &amp; <hi>ſtile,</hi> he entertaines, after his accuſtomed maner, with ſome paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> For expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding my ſelf, that I wold not maintain <hi>this or that mans editio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures wel and faithfully tranſlated,</hi> in ſuch maner as our Church allows them: he cals this a <hi>ſtarting hole:</hi> neuer reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring how himſelf wil not defend <hi>this or that edition</hi> in his own Church, but wil retire to thoſe editions that are approued: as alſo the primitiue Church permitted varietie of tranſlations, and yet followed the pureſt, as neare as it could iudge of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the time being. I wil therfore ſay it again, that OVR ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS, AS TOVCHING THE MATTER CONTAINED THEREIN, ARE INFALLIBLE, AND THE DIVINE IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPIRED WORD OF GOD, THAT IS THE RVLE OF FAITH. And my aduerſary is but a meane diſputer, if he thinke to diſproue this by obiecting ſome verball errors. For either they wil proue no errors at all; or if they do, D. Stapleton ſhall tell him, <hi>they hinder nothing the truth of the matter, nor the integritie of the text:</hi> and I will giue him a whole legion of his owne writers, that ſhall impute as foule errors to his Trent vulgar, which yet he thinkes infallible. Neuertheleſſe his arguments in diſproofe of that I ſay, are three. Firſt, the teſtimonies of Martin, Reynolds, and the Grounds of the new religion. Secondly, the teſtimonie of M. Broughton and Carlile. Thirdly the diuerſitie of tranſlations in our Church. Wherto I anſwer firſt in general, that I ſatisfied theſe reaſons ſufficiently in my booke; and gaue direct anſwer to them: whereto he hath replied nothing, but onely repeates his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections. He was therefore too haſtie, to call that <hi>bold, blinde,</hi> and <hi>falſe,</hi> which he could not reply to; &amp; me <hi>brazen faced</hi> that ſaid no more but what himſelf giues experience of For I ſaid <hi>Martin could not giue one inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of any ſence corrupted in our tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;</hi> &amp; himſelf, in ſtead of producing ſomwhat out of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, breaks out into railing: which is folly. For cocks of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> game are not allowed to crow til they haue beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their mate: for he
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:20570:153"/> that crowes, and yet runnes away, is a crauin, and ſhall haue his necke wrung off, or be turned to the dunghill to crow among hens. Secondly I anſwer in particular: to the firſt,
<note place="margin">ad 1.</note> it is but a fooliſh brag, to be contemned. To the ſecond,

His D. Stapleton

<note place="margin">White, pag. 25. 39. 36.</note> M. White ſeemeth to grant, when he requireth ſo many other, euen <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes and helpes, beſides the inward ſpirit,</hi> to the vnderſtanding of the Scripture.

For ſuch is that, which for the preſent I call the rule of faith; or the rule and meanes, by which all ſorts may without other meanes <hi>(ne detur proceſſus in infinitum)</hi> be ſufficiently inſtructed in all matters of faith. If M. Wotton and M White, impertinently to this our purpoſe, wil needs ſtriue to haue the Scripture called (in ſome other ſence) the rule of faith; I will not ſtriue with them, but do freely grant, it may be ſo called: as good written lawes are or may be called the rule of manners, in a commonwealth. But as <hi>beſides</hi> good written lawes in a commonwealth, there are required ordinarily both good <hi>vnwritten cuſtomes,</hi> and a good <hi>liuing Magiſtrate (hauing authoritie to propound and interprete both written lawes and vnwritten cuſtomes)</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the written lawes alone were not a ſufficient rule and means to preſerue good manners in a commonwealth, in regard the lawes cannot be ſo plaine, but that (conſidering the weakneſſe, ignorance, and peruerſitie of men) they may and would be miſunderſtood, and wreſted to a wrong ſence; which inconuenience is remedied, partly by vnwritten cuſtomes, which do beſt interprete the written lawes, partly by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the liuing magiſtrate, who may <hi>by authoritie declare</hi> which is the right ſence, and may <hi>compell</hi> men to execute written lawes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that ſence: Euen ſo in the Church, <hi>beſides the diuine infallible written Scriptures,</hi> there muſt be admitted ſome diuine infallible vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written traditions, and ſome <hi>alwayes liuing magiſtrate (hauing infallible authoritie to propound and expound the Scriptures)</hi> without which the written Scriptures alone were not a ſufficient rule and meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue infallible faith in the Church, becauſe the Scriptures are not ſo plaine, but that (conſidering the weakneſſe, ignorance, and peruerſnes of men) they may be, and (as experience ordinarily teacheth) are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood, and wreſted to a wrong ſence: which inconuenience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out miracle, cannot be remedied, vnleſſe we admit <hi>vnwritten traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which are <hi>the beſt ordinary interpreters</hi> of Scripture, and ſome <hi>liuing magiſtrate</hi> (hauing infallible authoritie) who may (when controuerſies ariſe) infallibly declare which is the right ſence, and who by that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, may <hi>compell</hi> men to take them in that ſence.

                     <note place="margin">Wotton, pa 70.

Chryſoſt.) <hi>euery man of himſelf by reading may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</hi> To this I reply, firſt, that although ſome places of Scripture be <hi>more plaine</hi> then others, and are, and may be called <hi>abſolutely plain; partly</hi> for that they be ſet downe in proper, and not figuratiue ſpeech: <hi>partly</hi> in that to them who haue once learned the true interpretation of the Church, they ſeeme ſo plaine, as they need nothing but reading or hearing, to make them plaine: <hi>partly</hi> for that ſome places are ſo plaine, as they need nothing to make them plainly vnderſtood of a very child, but this generall rule, told vs by the Church, that the words in ſuch places are to be plainly vnderſtood as they ſound, yet this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it doth not follow that the Scripture <hi>alone (euen in thoſe moſt plaine places)</hi> is the rule and meanes which ſhould inſtruct men in faith: becauſe ſith ſome places (ſeeming proper and plaine) are not to be taken as the words ſound, but are oftentimes to be vnderſtood by a figure: what man without ſome infallible meanes beſides ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming plainneſſe of the words, can be infalliby aſſured euen in moſt plaine places, that he vnderſtandeth the right ſence? eſpecially when the moſt plaine places that are, may be, and ordinarily are (either by weakneſſe, ignorance or peruerſneſſe of men) wreſted to a wrong ſence, as we ſee that moſt plaine place, where our Sauiour pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> to be (by Caluiniſts) wreſted to a figuratiue ſence. Beſides therefore the bare letter of Scripture, though neuer ſo plaine, to haue infallible aſſurance of the ſence, there is required ſome other infallible rule and meanes to aſſure vs when and where the words ſeeming plaine, are to be vnderſtood properly as they ſound: and when they are to be taken in a figuratiue or improper ſence. This, ſay I, is not to be learned ſufficiently in <hi>the bare letter</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>alone,</hi> but is to be learned of the Church, according to that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſaying of Vincentius Lyrinenſis:

                     <hi>Becauſe all men do not take the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture for the height of it, in one and the ſame ſence; but diuers men interpret the ſayings of it diuerſly; in ſo much that almoſt ſo many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſences may ſeeme poſſible to be drawne from it, as there are diuers men, &amp;c. Therefore it is very neceſſarie, that the line of Propheticall and Apoſtolicall interpretation, be directed according to the rule of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall and Catholicke ſence.</hi> True it is, that by other probable meanes, viz. rules of art, knowledge of tongues, obſeruation of circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, conference of places, &amp;c. one (but not euery lay-man, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and childe, euen of <hi>M Wotton</hi> and <hi>M. Whites</hi> owne pariſh) may probably finde out, when the words are, and when they are not to be vnderſtood properly: but infallibly in ſuch ſort, as to build there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon infallible aſſent of faith, one cannot, without infallible inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, had either immediatly by reuelation of the Spirit (which
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:20570:157"/> is not ordinarily to be expected) or by infallible authoritie of the Church. True it is alſo, that ordinarily Diuines hold it for a certaine rule, that <hi>words of Scripture are to be vnderſtood properly as they ſound, vnleſſe to auoide ſome abſurditie, we be compelled to interprete by a figure.</hi> But when ſuch an abſurditie occurreth, that ought to compell vs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete plaine words of Scripture by a figure, and when not; although reaſon it ſelfe may probably know (which probable knowledge may ſuffice for direction of manners) yet infallibly in ſuch ſort as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the aſſent of faith, reaſon alone not aſſiſted by Church authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, cannot (at the leaſt alwayes) tell; ſith many things may ſeeme <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd</hi> to our priuate ſence and reaſon, which in truth are not abſurd; as in the myſtery of the bleſſed Trinitie may plainly appeare: and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, many things may ſeeme in reaſon not abſurd, which in true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie are abſurd and moſt falſe.</q>

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:20570:158"/> condition of Gods grace, and the Churches teaching, and our owne endeuour, to open our vnderſtanding, euen in the plaineſt Scripture that is, but I onely affirme, <hi>all things concerning faith and good life, needfull to be knowne, to be ſo plainly ſet downe therein, that the vnlearnedſt man aliue, vſing the meanes</hi> (which is not the Church-authoritie intended by my aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary) <hi>and being enlightned with Gods Spirit, may ſufficiently vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them to his ſaluation;</hi> which is enough to make it a rule perfect, entire, and as eaſie as is poſſible for a rule to be, for the finding out and deciding whatſoeuer matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to faith. For howſoeuer ſome things in the Scripture, the knowledge whereof is not ſimply neceſſary to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be very obſcure and doubtfull; yet <hi>the whole rule</hi> of our faith, needfull to all men, is ſet downe ſo plainly, that it may be vnderſtood of <hi>all men,</hi> allowing them ſome eleuation, and onely ſuppoſing them to haue the light of grace, and to take that paines in ſearching, that is ordinarily required in the vſe of any rule, and in the execution of any meanes whatſoeuer.

And that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of vſing meanes and outward helpes, takes not away the reaſon of a rule, he muſt confeſſe by his owne principles: for let his Church-teaching and authoritie, his owne <hi>Helena,</hi> be the rule; yet afore any man can determinately know it, or vnderſtand and yeeld to it, he muſt, I hope, haue the <hi>grace

This therefore is a vaſte partialitie in my Ieſuite, that he will conclude a thing cannot be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent rule or meanes, that requires the helpe of grace and a mans owne induſtrie in the applying it, when themſelues holding their Church to be the rule, yet confeſſe, that no man can heare the voice thereof, not vnderſtand nor yeeld aſſent to it, without the very ſame meanes that we require for the vnderſtanding of the Scriptures.

Secondly, becauſe the plaineſt places that are, may be wreſted to a wrong ſenſe, as that plaine place, <hi>This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> is wreſted by the Caluiniſts, to a figuratiue ſenſe. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, his reaſon why Scripture <hi>alone</hi> could not be the rule of faith, was becauſe it is not plaine; the which obſcurity I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to be in that which is neceſſary to be knowne, affirming the Scripture, in ſuch places, to be plaine; now he replies, that though ſuch places be plaine, yet ſtill it cannot be the rule. Thus firſt he denies the Scripture to be the rule, becauſe it is not plaine; and then allowing it againe, to be plaine, yet ſtill he denies it to be the rule. What will this man ſtand to I maruell? But they be not <hi>plaine enough,</hi> becauſe <hi>without ſome other infallible meanes,</hi> beſides <hi>the ſeeming plainenes of the words,</hi> no man can be infallibly aſſured, that he vnderſtands aright, euen thoſe plaine places This abſurd cauill, I haue anſwered twenty times: firſt, that the <hi>meanes</hi> whereby this is done, are the helpe of Gods Spirit, our owne diligence, the Church-teaching, the light of nature: and theſe meanes are infallible; And theſe meanes I admit, either <hi>coniunctim,</hi> or <hi>diuiſim,</hi> to be neceſſary, as a condition and <hi>medium</hi> for the full aſſurance of vnderſtanding theſe places: but this condition takes not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the true motion, and reaſons of plaineneſſe from them; for, as I anſwered in my booke to this argument, <hi>that is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, which by ordinary, and eaſie meanes may be vnderſtood, but which, either hath no meanes at all to open it, or onely ſuch as are not ordinary:</hi> to his confirmation,
<note n="d" place="margin">THE WAY p. 36. n. 2.</note> I anſwered likewiſe. But to his inſtances, of the <hi>Caluiniſts,</hi> wreſting a plaine place, <hi>This is my body,</hi> to a figuratiue ſenſe, I reply, firſt it is plaine, and euident, that it is a figure, by the circumſtances of the place, when he that ſaid the words, <hi>This is my body, that is giuen for you,</hi> at the ſame inſtant, held nothing but <hi>bread</hi> in his hand,

                  </note> This is the finall euaſion that the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites vſe againſt this argument in defence of their traditions, and Popes authority, againſt the ſufficiency of the Scripture: that <hi>the Scriptures haue in them a ſhining light, and are, as</hi> the Proteſtants ſay, <hi>able to proue themſelues to be the word of God, and containe their true ſenſe in themſelues: but this light we ſee not, and this true ſenſe we know not; and this aſſurance, that they
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:20570:164"/> are Gods word, or that this is the true ſenſe, we cannot haue in the Scripture it ſelfe: but by the meanes of Traditions, and the Popes authoritie ſhewing, and propounding theſe things to vs. As a candle though hauing light in it ſelfe, yet ſhewes light to none, when it is hid vnder a buſhell, but when it is ſet vpon a Candleſticke.</hi> I anſwer 2. things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> as I haue often ſaid, this authority, and teaching of the Church, is not alway, nor ſimply, neceſſary to ſhew all men the light of the Scripture, or ſo much as to point to it: for either by the immediate light of Gods Spirit, or by the light of nature, it may be knowne to be Gods word, as by the light of nature it is knowne that God is: whereupon it followes plainely, that the Scripture alone, as the Rule, hath this light in it ſelfe, and <hi>from it ſelfe ſhewes it,</hi> elſe it could not, in this manner, without Church propoſition, ſhine to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. <hi>Secondly</hi> I grant, that ordinarily, for the ſeeing, and diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, perfection, purity, power, ſence, &amp; all this light that is in the Scripture; the propoſition of the Church is neceſſary, as a candleſticke to hold it forth, but then this propoſition may be expounded two waies: <hi>one way</hi> to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>ſuch authority,</hi> as by, and from it ſelfe, induces me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue afore I ſee any authority in the Scripture, and together with the authority of the Scripture: the twofold authority of the Church, and Scripture concurring to the moouing of my vnderſtanding, as when two men concurre, as one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall beginning; to the carrying, and moouing of a blocke. This Church propoſition thus expounded, I vtterly deny to be either needfull, or poſſible. <hi>Secondly</hi> it may be expounded for the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the Church, by her Paſtors, and people, reuealing the Scriptures to them that know them not, and teaching the nature, ſenſe, and meaning thereof. But this miniſtry is but a <hi>bare condition</hi> adding no light, ſenſe, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or matter to the Scripture, but onely leading vs to ſee it. Of which Miniſtery there is no queſtion betweene vs: for all Proteſtants grant,
<note place="margin">The authority, or miniſtery of the Church, ſuppoſes no want of light in the Scripture.</note> and vſe it: but the queſtion is, <hi>whether all the articles, and whole nature of faith, be contained in Scripture alone, excluding vnwritten traditions, though the Miniſtery of the Church be needfull, as an inſtrument to ſhew, teach, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:20570:164"/> the Scripture, as a candleſticke is needfull to ſhew the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle?</hi> For the vſe of this Miniſtry, and requiſite condition of all other meanes, that are to be vſed, ſuppoſes no want, or defect in the obiect, whereabout they are applied, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produces it to his operation: as the ſetting of a candle vpon the ſocket, addes no light to it that was wanting in it ſelfe, but onely remoues ſome impediments that hinder the ſtanders by from ſeeing, and the opening of a window to let in light makes not the Sunne imperfect, or but a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all light. And if our aduerſaries intended no more but this, there were an end of the controuerſie, for no Proteſtant euer denied the neceſſity of Church miniſtry in this ſenſe, but freely confeſſe it, although the authority
<note n="*" place="margin">See it expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Chap. 35. n. 1. &amp; inde. and here immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly after, in nu. 4.</note> mentioned we renounce.</p>
               <p n="4">4 For the better explication of this my anſwer, and that the Reader may ſee how impertinent it is, that my Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſayes: Note FIRST, that
<note n="o" place="margin">The queſt. betweene vs &amp; the Papiſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches authority.</note> the queſtion is not <hi>whether ſome meanes be ordinarily required</hi> to the vnderſtanding of the Scripture, and the producing of faith in ſuch, as reade, and vſe it: nor whether the Scripture worke infallible aſſurance <hi>immediatly,</hi> in all men (for in ſome it doth) without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and coming betweene of the Church miniſtery. For we hold it doth not. But the point is, whether this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, ſupply any article of faith, or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter needfull to ſaluation, that is wanting in the Scripture, ſo that it may be ſaid, as my Aduerſary alway ſpeaketh, the Scripture alone, is <hi>but a part</hi> of the rule of faith, which God hath left to inſtruct men, <hi>what is</hi> to be holden for faith: and there be <hi>many ſubſtantiall points,</hi> belonging to faith, which are contained in Scripture alone, nether expreſly, nor thence to be deduced by conſequence, but to be ſupplied by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Church authority: and ſo the queſtion is not about the expediency, or condition of the meanes, but about the perfection, and ſufficiency of the thing it ſelfe. Note SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CONDLY, that my aduerſary from the neceſſity of the means, concludes the inſufficiency of the thing, thus: <hi>The light of the Scripture, ſhines not to vs: the true ſenſe of the Scripture is
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:20570:165"/> not infallibly aſſured vnto vs without the meanes of the Church: The Scripture therefore is vnſufficient, not containing all things needfull: not inſtructing vs,</hi> WHAT <hi>is to be holden for matter of faith:</hi> as if a man ſhould ſay, the light of the candle appeares not to vs, but when it is ſet on a candleſticke: therefore there is much light that is wanting in the candle, and is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the candleſticke. Note THIRDLY what the things properly are, which our aduerſaries attribute to the Church, in comparing it with the Scripture. They are there: firſt, to be <hi>a meanes</hi> to reueale and expound the Scripture to vs; and to breed the faith thereof in our conſciences. Secondly, to be the <hi>Foundation</hi> of our faith, in this ſenſe; that we do beleeue this to be Scripture; and this to be the true ſenſe of the Scripture, and this to be the matter of faith, <hi>onely</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church expounds the Scripture ſo. Thirdly, to <hi>ſupply vnto vs many articles</hi> of faith, abſolutely needfull to ſaluation, that are wanting in the Scripture, out of tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by the ſaid tradition to expound the Scripture. Theſe two latter points they infer on of the firſt, which is the incroching conſequence that I except againſt, in that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, wherein God hath placed his Church, is not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Scripture, but in reſpect of vs, being a bare Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to the Scripture. D. Stapleton
<note n="a" place="margin">Relect. p. 462.</note> ſayes, <hi>The Church is the ground, and pillar of truth in a higher kind, then the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> namely <hi>in the kind of the efficient cauſe.</hi> And
<note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 494. in explicat. qu.</note> 
                  <hi>the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church may be vnderſtood to be greater then the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Scripture, becauſe it is not ſimply ſubiect, or bound to it, but may by it authority teach, &amp; decerne, ſomething which the Scripture hath neither determined, nor taught. — The things which the Church teaches do as much binde the faithfull, as thoſe things which the Scripture teacheth, — we Catholickes affirme that the Church is to be heard more certainely then the Scriptures, becauſe the doctrine thereof, is more manifeſt, and euident, then the doctrine of the Scriptures, or at the leaſt, equally with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becauſe the authority thereof is no leſſe irrefragable, and infallible. — The Scripture is the booke of the Church, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of truth, which the Church teſtifies, the law of God, which
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:20570:165"/> the Church hath publiſht, the rule of faith which the Church hath deliuered.</hi> We had wont to maruell at the blaſphemies
<note n="c" place="margin">Illyric. clau. ſcript. p. 541. Hoſ de expreſſ. verb. Dei.</note> of <hi>Cuſanus, Verratus, Hoſius:</hi> That <hi>the Church hath authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Scripture. The Scripture as it is produced by heretikes, is the word of the Diuell. A Councell is the higheſt tribunall, and hath the ſame power to determine any thing, that the Councell of the Apoſtles, and Diſciples had.—The things written in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, haue no ſoundneſſe, but through the determination of the Church: &amp;c.</hi> But now you ſee, the ſame renewed in that Church to this day, and the Ieſuits, in the midſt of their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſubtilties, to be as groſſe, as the groſſeſt Friars, preferring their Church authority farre aboue the Scriptures, or any vſe that a Candleſticke can haue in ſhewing the candle. Note FOVRTHLY what it is that the Proteſtants ſay, touching the authority of the Scripture, and the Church, ſo much as belongs to the preſent occaſion. Firſt, that the Scriptures haue in them a light, and an authoritie of <hi>their owne,</hi> ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to prooue themſelues to be the word of God, and to giue infallible aſſurance, to all men of the true ſenſe: and this light, and authority is not <hi>added, increaſed,</hi> or <hi>multiplied,</hi> by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Church, or any thing that it doth about the Scripture. Secondly, this light, and authoritie of the Scripture, ſhines in vs, and takes effect in vs, then onely, when the Spirit of God opens our hearts to ſee it. The defect of which heauenly illumination is the reaſon, why ſome neuer, and the elect themſelues, at all times do not ſee it, but it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues no defect of light in the Scriptures. Thirdly, the means whereby God opens our eies, and hearts to ſee this light, and authoritie in the Scripture, is <hi>the Miniſtry of the Church;</hi> I expound my ſelfe, it is the <hi>ordinary,</hi> and <hi>publike</hi> meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he referres men. And this Miniſtry is by <hi>preaching,</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding</hi> the Scripture, <hi>out of it ſelfe,</hi> and perſwading, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincing the conſciences of men: yet priuately, and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, when, and whereſoeuer this Miniſtry failes, or ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; the light, and ſenſe of the Scripture is obtained by the <hi>Scripture alone,</hi> without this Church Miniſtry: and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>alone</hi> in this ſort immediately, at ſundry times, by it

Therefore the former; Therefore the Scripture alone is the rule of faith.</p>
               <p n="6">6 My aduerſarie ſaies <hi>it troubles</hi> vs, that he ſayes, <hi>there be diues queſtions of faith, which are not expreſſely ſet downe, nor determined in the Scripture.</hi> Whereto I anſwered, that this was not the queſtion, for if by <hi>expreſſely</hi> he meant, written <hi>word for word,</hi> in ſo many ſyllables, then the rule is not bound to containe all things <hi>thus</hi> expreſſely; it being ſufficient, if all things needefull were contained therein in reſpect of the ſenſe, ſo that it might be gathered from thence by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: the queſtion not being, <hi>in what manner,</hi> but <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any way at all,</hi> the whole, and entire obiect of our faith be reuealed in the Scripture, though ſome part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be gathered but <hi>by Conſequence</hi> from that which is written <hi>expreſſely</hi> in ſo many ſyllables.

               </argument>
               <epigraph>
                  <q>A. D. To my anſwer of the Proteſtant obiection, whereas I ſay,
<note place="margin">Pag. 190.</note> the Apoſtle affirming the Scripture to be <hi>profitable,</hi> doth not auouch the alone <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of it: Whereas alſo ſecondly I ſay, <hi>it is rather profitable, in that it commendeth the authority of the Church, which is ſufficient:</hi> M. White replieth againſt the firſt part of this my anſwer;
<note place="margin">White. pag. 55.</note> that when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the Scripture is profitable, &amp;c.</hi> he meaneth, that it is <hi>ſo</hi> profitable, that a man by vſing it, may be made perfect to euery worke; and thereupon thus he reaſoneth, <hi>We do not ſay Scripture is profitable, Ergo ſufficient: but it is profitable to euery thing, Ergo ſufficient,</hi> I anſwer that this conſequence is not good: <hi>Piety</hi> is by S. Paul ſaid to be <hi>profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to euery thing;</hi> doth it therefore follow, that it is <hi>ſufficient</hi> in ſuch ſort, that there need no other helpe, or meanes to be ioyned with it, to attaine whatſoeuer thing? M. Wootton, and M. White ſeeme to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon more ſtrongly, yet weakely enough to this effect. <hi>That is ſufficient which is able to make a man wiſe to ſaluation, and which is profitable (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the word profitable, as expounded by the word able) to make one abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and perfect, &amp;c. But the Apoſtle affirmeth Scripture to be</hi> able, <hi>and profitable to the foreſaid purpoſes. Ergo.</hi> To this I anſwer, that if they had put into the argument, the word <hi>alone</hi> (of which all the queſtion is) it would more plainly appeare, how it proueth nothing. Secondly I might ſay that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of <hi>the old Teſtament,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Wootton. p. 97</note> as M. Wootton gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:20570:168"/> yea of euery parcell thereof, as the word <hi>Omnis</hi> ſignifieth: yet I hope, that neither M. Wootton, nor M. White will ſay, that now the old Teſtament, without the new, and much leſſe <hi>euery parcell</hi> of the old, is, of it ſelfe alone, ſufficient for all the foreſaid purpoſes. For if ſo, what need were there of the new Teſtament, or of the other parts, beſides any one parcell of the old? Thirdly I ſay, that the word <hi>profitable,</hi> is not to be expounded by the word <hi>able:</hi> and if it were, the word <hi>able</hi> doth not ſignifie, that the Scripture is ſo able, as to worke that effect, <hi>without any other meanes,</hi> or helpes concurring with it; but at the moſt, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <hi>a great degree of profitableneſſe.</hi> Or if it import <hi>ſufficiency,</hi> it is not meant, that <hi>alone ſufficiency,</hi> of which our queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, but at the moſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, <hi>in ſuo genere,</hi> in a certaine limited kind, to wit, <hi>of written Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Againſt the ſecond part of my anſwer, firſt M. White either had a corrupt copie of my treatiſe: or elſe himſelfe, his writer, or printer, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth euen my words, and ſenſe. For I do not ſay (as he maketh me) <hi>the Scripture is ſufficient, becauſe &amp;c.</hi> But I ſay onely, that it is <hi>profitable, the rather becauſe it commendeth the authority of the Church.</hi> By which corruption, he maketh himſelfe matter to worke vpon: but very idlely, moſt of his obiections being ouerthrowne, only by reading my words aright, as I ſet them downe. His chiefe obiection is this. <hi>The Scriptures are able to make the man of God perfect; that is, the Paſtours, the Pope, Councell, and all: but it cannot ſend theſe to the Church; becauſe theſe be the Church.</hi> I anſwer, that it ſendeth euen theſe alſo to the Church. Firſt in that it ſendeth them to the interpretation of <hi>Councels,</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> of the ancient Church. Secondly it ſendeth them, as they are <hi>priuate</hi> men, needing inſtruction, to <hi>themſelues,</hi> as <hi>authorized Paſtours,</hi> who by the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, ſhall be enabled, as neede ſhall require, for their owne, and other mens inſtruction, to define rightly, which is the right doctrine of faith in any point, wherein Controuerſie ſhall ariſe. The anſwer of his other obiections may without difficulty be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of that, which here I haue ſaid already, and which I am after to ſay, when I do ſhew how Church authority is prooued out of Scripture. Whence followeth not, that other places of Scripture, either are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, or not to be accounted part of the rule; or that Church doctrine is to be oppoſed to Scripture, or to be accounted humane traditions, or doctrine of men. The ſentences of Fathers, and others which M. White bringeth to proue alone ſufficiency of Scripture, either proue nothing againſt me, to wit, being explicated, that the Scriptures, with other meanes prouided by God, (namely the authority of the Church) are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to inſtruct vs: or elſe they proue againſt him, and his fellow M. Wootton, as well as againſt me, if the Fathers words be taken without limitation, that the Scriptures <hi>alone,</hi> without any meanes ioyned to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are able to inſtruct vs in all things. And it is maruaile that theſe men haue ſo little iudgement, to alledge ſuch authorities, which make no more againe <hi>Church-authority,</hi> required by me, then againſt <hi>Church-ministery,</hi>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:20570:168"/> which is required by themſelues, as the ordinary meanes to inſtruct men in faith.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p n="1">1 The Apoſtle 2. Tim. 3.15. hath theſe words. <hi>The holy Scriptures are</hi> ABLE <hi>to make thee wiſe</hi> TO SALVATION <hi>through</hi> THE FAITH, WHICH IS IN CHRIST IESVS. <hi>For the whole Scripture is inſpired of God, and is profitable to</hi> TEACH, <hi>to</hi> IMPROVE, <hi>to</hi> CORRECT, <hi>to</hi> INSTRVCT IN ALL RIGHTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OVSNESSE: <hi>That the man of God may be</hi> ABSOLVTE, <hi>and made</hi> PERFECT, VNTO ALL GOOD WORKES. This text we alledge to proue the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of the Scripture, whereto my Aduerſary in his diſcourſe
<note n="a" place="margin">In the WAY. §. 11.</note> anſwered two things. Firſt, that the Apoſtle doth not ſay in theſe words, <hi>that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſufficient to inſtruct a man to perfection,</hi> but <hi>that it is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi> but I ſhewed that he affirmes it to be SVFFICIENT by three reaſons: the firſt, becauſe the Apoſtle ſayes, They are <hi>able to make vs</hi> PERFECT, and that <hi>to</hi> EVERY <hi>good worke:</hi> now that which doth this, is <hi>ſufficient,</hi> inaſmuch as God requires no more at any mans hand, but <hi>perfection to euery good worke.</hi> My Aduerſary in this his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſed Reply (wherin he durſt not deale openly, and diſtinctly, that I might perfectly diſcerne, which part of my argument, his words properly concerne) ſeemes to deny the conſequence, becauſe S. Paul ſayes alſo, that <hi>Piety is profitable to euery thing; and yet it is not ſufficient in ſuch ſort, that there needs no other helpe, or meanes to be ioyned with it,</hi> to attaine whatſoeuer thing. Whereto I reply againe. Firſt, that euen this <hi>Piety,</hi> being the totall, and whole effect, that the ſtudy of the Scripture works in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ioyning of any thing elſe to it, that is not Piety; for it followes in the next words; that this Piety hath <hi>the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this life, and of the life to come:</hi> that is to ſay, whatſoeuer is promiſed vs in this world or in the next, is obtained by Piety. Therefore Piety is ſufficient. Therefore any thing in this example notwithſtanding, the Scriptures being affirmed to be <hi>profitable to euery thing,</hi> are affirmed alſo to be <hi>ſufficient.</hi> Secondly, we do not maintaine the Scripture to be ſufficient
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:20570:169"/> in that ſenſe, that <hi>without all helpe, and meanes to learne them,</hi> they will ſuffice; for who euer denied the miniſtery of the <hi>Church,</hi> the illumination of Gods <hi>Spirit,</hi> and a mans owne ſyncere <hi>indeuour</hi> to be alſo requiſite? But when we ſay they are ſufficient, we do it againſt the aſſertion, that ſayes, they containe not the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of al things needful to be knowne; but beſides the meanes to vnderſtand, and learne them, we need Church authority, and vnwritten tradition, to ſupply diuers articles of faith, that they reueale not. Thirdly, my Aduerſary may poſſibly finde ſome formes of ſpeech, where a thing is called <hi>profitable</hi> to all things; yet other things are as neceſſary as it; for the profitablenes of one thing, excludes not the neceſſity of another thing. But whereſoeuer it is ſaid, that any thing is <hi>profitable</hi> (not ſimply to this, or that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) but to make perſect to <hi>euery thing in the ſame kind,</hi> there the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> thereof is abſolutely concluded: and thus the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the Scripture, that it is <hi>profitable to make</hi> PERFECT <hi>to</hi> EVERY <hi>good worke.</hi> The ſaid <hi>perfection</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an effect of their <hi>profitableneſſe:</hi> for that <hi>profitable</hi> thing is ſufficient of it ſelfe, that makes, and produces the effect perfect.</p>
               <p n="2">2 My ſecond reaſon, whereby I ſhewed the ſufficiency of the Scripture was this: <hi>All that we need to ſaluation is either to be taught, or reproued, or inſtructed, or corrected: but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone doth all this. Ergo they are ſufficient:</hi> to this he anſwers nothing.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly I reaſoned thus, <hi>That is ſufficient, and containes all things needfull to be knowne, which is able to make a man wiſe to ſaluation; but the Scripture is able to doe this: Ergo it is ſufficient:</hi> this argument he hath tumultuouſly repeated, as he hath all the reſt, and anſwered I know not how. Firſt, he ſayes, if the word <hi>alone</hi> had bene put in, it would <hi>more plainely appeare, how it proues nothing,</hi> let the world therefore be put in: <hi>That which alone is able to make a man wiſe to ſaluation is ſufficient, but ſuch is the Scripture, that alone it is able to make a man wiſe to ſaluation, Therefore it is ſufficient.</hi> How doth it now appeare ſo plainely that it proues nothing? the firſt propoſition is manifeſt of it
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:20570:169"/> ſelfe, the ſecond is as manifeſt; for all that the Apoſtle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes, is of the Scripture <hi>alone,</hi> and of nothing elſe; for of Scripture <hi>alone,</hi> he ſaies, it is able to make <hi>wiſe to ſaluation,</hi> it is <hi>profitable to teach, to reproue, to inſtruct, to correct, that the man of God may be perfect,</hi> the concluſion therfore muſt needs be true. Secondly he ſaies, the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the <hi>old Teſtament</hi> yea of <hi>euery parcell</hi> of Scripture, <hi>yet M. White will not ſay, that, now ſpecially, the old Teſtament, without the New, or euery parcell of the old it ſelfe, is alone ſufficient for all the ſaid pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,</hi> whereto M. White anſwers, that he neither ſpeakes of the <hi>old Teſtament alone,</hi> nor of any one <hi>parcell,</hi> either of old, or new ſeparated from the reſt, but of <hi>the whole,</hi> in this ſenſe <hi>all the whole Scripture taken together is able, &amp;c.</hi> And if the Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, and D. Stapleton, whom this man traces, had not renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all truth, they would not ſay it, when that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle auouches of the Scripture, cannot agree to <hi>euery parcel alone,</hi> but to <hi>all together,</hi> for what one parcell performes all theſe effects, to <hi>make wiſe</hi> to ſaluation, to <hi>teach,</hi> to <hi>reproue</hi> to <hi>inſtruct,</hi> to <hi>correct,</hi> to <hi>make perfect?</hi> the Scripture is ſo vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as that all theſe things may truly be affirmed of it, but theſe things cannot truely be affirmed of the parcels alone: Ergo.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Thirdly he ſaies <hi>the word</hi> PROFITABLE <hi>muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the word</hi> ABLE, <hi>or if it be, the word</hi> ABLE <hi>doth not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that the Scripture is ſo able, as to worke that effect without any other meanes, or helpes, concurring with it, but at the moſt it imports a great degree of profitableneſſe.</hi> This is no anſwer to this argument. But to another that he hath not expreſſed. I ſaid therefore thirdly, though very briefly, <hi>By the word able, the other word profitable muſt be expounded. Which I thus</hi> put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to forme: <hi>that which is</hi> PROFITABLE, <hi>by being</hi> ABLE, <hi>is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: the Scripture is ſo</hi> PROFITABLE, <hi>that it is</hi> ABLE <hi>to make vs wiſe to ſaluation: Ergo it is ſufficient.</hi> He firſt denies the Minor, and ſaies, the word profitable, is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the word Able: but he ſeemes to be dazeled. For: <hi>that which is able to make wiſe to ſaluation, muſt needes be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make abſolute, and perfect, becauſe perfection conſiſts in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:20570:170"/> wife to ſaluation: but the Scripture alone is able to make wiſe to ſaluation: Ergo.</hi> Next he ſaies, that ſuppoſing the word PROFITABLE be expounded by the word ABLE: thus, Scripture is <hi>able</hi> to make one abſolute, and perfect: <hi>yet the meaning is not that it is able without other helpes, and meanes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with it, but at the moſt, that it is very profitable: and if it be ſufficient, yet this ſufficiency is not that whereof our queſtion is, but in a certaine limited kinde, to wit, of written Scripture.</hi> That is to ſay: if by <hi>able to make vs wiſe to ſaluation,</hi> be meant that the Scriptures are <hi>ſufficient,</hi> yet it is not meant, that, <hi>alone</hi> they are ſufficient, as the Proteſtants hold; but <hi>with a limitation, ſo far as Scripture can be ſufficient.</hi> In which his anſwer he plainely diſcouers himſelfe to be foundred, and ſpent. For our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not, whether the Scripture <hi>alone, without vſing the Miniſtery of the Church,</hi> or <hi>our owne induſtry,</hi> or ſuch <hi>meanes,</hi> as God hath appointed for the finding our, and vnderſtanding of that which is contained in it, be ſufficient: for Bread, and Drinke, and all manner of food, is not ſufficient to ſuſtaine mans life, if he take no paines to get it, or if he be not able to ſwallow, and digeſt it: and my aduerſaries owne <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>traditions,</hi> with all their royalties, are not <hi>ſufficient,</hi> vnleſſe men take paines to finde them, and be ſo mad as to beleeue them, and ſo blinde as to let them downe: but the queſtion is of their <hi>latitude,</hi> and <hi>extent,</hi> viz. <hi>whether the written Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture containe, in expreſſe words, or ſenſe, the whole, and entire do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith, and good life, ſo that the Church by her authoritie, and traditions, may adde no point of faith, that is wanting in the Scripture.</hi> This appeares to be the queſtion by my aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries own words: and the words of the Diuines in his Church. Now the Apoſtle ſaying, the Scripture is <hi>able</hi> to make one wiſe <hi>to ſaluation,</hi> affirmes the ſufficiency of it <hi>alone,</hi> without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other helpe, or meanes, <hi>to ſupply any doctrine or matter of faith, not contained therein,</hi> becauſe there is no more needfull but to be <hi>wiſe to ſaluation,</hi> and that wiſdome the Scripture is able to inſtruct vs in. Which ability is not limited to certaine points, but extended to all the whole obiect of faith, by the word. For thus I reaſon: <hi>He ſpeakes of the Scripture alone, and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:20570:170"/> nothing elſe, therefore the Scripture alone is able to make wiſe to ſaluation: therefore it is ſo profitable, and in ſuch ſort, to make abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and perfect to euery good worke that it can do it. For it is able. Therefore it alone is ſufficient. Therefore this ſufficiency is ſo limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to written Scripture, that it is perfectly, and wholy contained in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 The ſecond part of my aduerſaries anſwer, in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to the text alleadged, was, that the Scripture is ſaid to be profitable, <hi>becauſe it commendes to vs the authority of the Church.</hi> This his anſwer I oppoſed with 7. arguments. But when I repeated it, I put in the word <hi>ſufficient,</hi> thus: <hi>He ſaies they be profitable, and</hi> SVFFICIENT <hi>becauſe they commend vnto vs the Churches authority,</hi> the addition of which word, you ſee, he diſtaſts, and makes a vantage of, thereby to put off the anſwer to ſixe of my arguments. That the Prouerbe might be true, its an ill winde, but blowes ſome men profite: for vnder that pretence, he takes occaſion to cauill, and put off that he could not anſwer. For firſt, the word might well be put in without any preiudice to his ſenſe. For if their <hi>profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe</hi> lie in commending to vs the Church authoritie, then their <hi>ſufficiency</hi> lyes there too: and ſo I might well make him ſay, they be <hi>profitable,</hi> and <hi>ſufficient,</hi> becauſe they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend vnto vs the Churches authority. Secondly, it is idle that he ſaies my obiections are ouerthrown, <hi>Only by reading his words aright,</hi> leauing out the word ſufficient. For let him looke vpon them againe, and he ſhall finde, they ourthrow his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>profitable,</hi> as well as if he had expounded, <hi>ſufficient,</hi> in the ſame manner. But my aduerſary will take a ſmall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſhun an argument.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Onely to the ſixth he replies: for whereas I ſaid the meaning cannot be, that they are profitable, <hi>becauſe they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto vs the Churches authority,</hi> becauſe the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>they are able to make the man of God perfect, that is, the Paſtor himſelfe, the Pope, the Councell, and all: and it were abſurd to ſay, that the Scriptures make the Church perfect by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending it to it ſelf;</hi> for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtles ſhould ſpeak thus by my aduerſaries expoſition, <hi>the Scriptures are profitable to make the Church per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:20570:171"/> by commending to it the authority of the Church:</hi> and yet he defendes it. Firſt, becauſe it ſendes them, Paſtors, Pope, Councell, and all, <hi>to the interpretations of Councels, and Fathers, of the ancient Church.</hi> But then I demand, how did they make perfect the <hi>ancient Church</hi> it ſelfe, the <hi>firſt Councels,</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> of whom the Apoſtle ſpeakes, as well as of the latter? for they had none to retire to, but the Scripture onely. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly becauſe <hi>the Paſtors of the Church ſuſtaine two perſons, one as publike Paſtors authorized to teach: another as priuate men, needing inſtruction themſelues,</hi> and ſo the Apoſtle ſaies, the Scripture ſends them, <hi>as priuate</hi> men to <hi>themſelues,</hi> conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as <hi>publike men,</hi> inabled as need ſhall require to define the truth in any point; the which is an irkeſome anſwer, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ſhall conſider it; for although a Paſtor be conſidered theſe 2. waies, yet it is falſe that is aſſumed, that <hi>he which as a priuate man erres, and is ignorant, yet as a publike perſon, is able to direct himſelfe, and others, and define the truth,</hi> this I ſay is a trick to mocke an ape with, though it be all the ſhift they haue to defend the Pope, from being a formall hereticke; and yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it to be true, that the Paſtors of the Church, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as priuate men, are ſent to <hi>themſelues conſidered as publike men,</hi> yet it cannot be true, that the Scripture makes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this way by ſending and commending them to <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,</hi> becauſe the perfection auouched is the effect of that <hi>teaching,</hi> that <hi>reprouing,</hi> that <hi>correcting,</hi> that <hi>inſtructing</hi> which is contained in the Scripture <hi>it ſelfe,</hi> and not in the authoritie of man, whither the Scripture is imagined to ſend vs. For all that the Apoſtle, in this text, affirmes, is of <hi>the Scripture alone,</hi> as appeares,</p>
               <p n="7">7 Beſides my argument, I alleadged ſome teſtimonies of Chryſoſtome, and certaine Papiſts, to iuſtifie my expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein they affirme as much out of the text, as I doe; whereto he replies, that the ſaid teſtimonies <hi>muſt either be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated to mean that the Scriptures are able to inſtruct vs with the meanes of Church authority, or elſe be taken without limitation; if they be thus explicated, they proue nothing againſt him, if they be taken without limitation, they proue as much againſt vs, as againſt
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:20570:171"/> him.</hi> I anſwer to the firſt, the teſtimonies are to be ſeene, and the words thereof are ſo full, that they cannot be thus expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated: as for example, Chryſoſtome in his words, expounds S. Paul to diſtinguiſh the Scripture againſt his owne miniſtry. <hi>Thou haſt the Scripture to teach thee in ſteed of me, if thou deſire to know anything, there thou maieſt learne it,</hi> that which can teach vs in ſteed of the Church Paſtours, can teach vs without their authority, &amp; if <hi>God</hi> as Antonin ſays, <hi>hath ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but once, &amp; that in the Scriptures, &amp; that ſo fully, that he ſpeakes no more,</hi> how can the meaning be, that other authority ſhould be ioyned with them? for ſo God ſhould ſpeake twice: once in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> another time in the <hi>Church,</hi> and in the Scripture ſo far from <hi>fully,</hi> that he needs ſpeake <hi>againe</hi> in the Church. The like may be ſaid to the other teſtimonies, but I refer the iudgement to the conſcience of the Reader. To the ſecond, <hi>if theſe words be taken without limitation,</hi> that alone without any means ioyned to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are able to inſtruct vs, <hi>they proue as much againſt me, as againſt him, that its maruell,</hi> I <hi>ſhould haue ſo little iudgement,</hi> I demand, and why ſo I pray? becauſe then they will make as much againſt our Church <hi>miniſtery,</hi> as againſt his Church <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:</hi> which had bene ſpoken to the point, if we by Church <hi>miniſtry,</hi> had meant either the ſame, or as much, as he doth by Church <hi>authority;</hi> but when his Church authority intends a <hi>ſupply of that which is wanting,</hi> in the Scripture by traditions, &amp; our Church miniſtry no more but <hi>a ſimple co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition</hi> of vſing the meanes, to make vs ſee, that which is contained in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which miniſtry alſo we do not hold to be alway, &amp; vnto all perſons, neceſſary, he may let our iudgements alone, and take a new reckoning of his owne, that is ſo ſimple, as to make alike things that are ſo far vnlike, his Church <hi>authority,</hi> and our Church <hi>miniſtry.</hi>

To this he replies, firſt, <hi>ô ſtrange oppoſition!</hi> but this he doth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the way, becauſe he would not looſe a Parentheſis. His head being ſo full of mentall reſeruations, that it makes his booke breake out all ouer into Parentheſes, as if it were full of the Meaſels: for when <hi>particular</hi> men, and <hi>priuate</hi> ſpirits do not erre by reaſon of their <hi>ſmall number,</hi> but by holding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that, which is <hi>diuine,</hi> and <hi>ſpirituall;</hi> what ſuch <hi>ſtrange</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is it, to oppoſe the <hi>priuate ſpirit,</hi> againſt the <hi>diuine Spirit</hi> of God: and a <hi>priuate</hi> man, againſt him that is <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all?</hi> In this ſenſe, <hi>No priuate mans ſpirit can be the rule, if by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate he meane not that which is not ſo common, but that which is not diuine, and ſpirituall.</hi> But this is not worth the ſtanding on: his ſecond exception is againſt the matter of the diſtinction. For I ſaid, <hi>a priuate man may be ſo aſſiſted by the holy Ghoſt, that he may interpret Scripture truely, and infallibly, againſt a company as bigge, as the Romane Church.</hi> To this he replies: denying my ſuppoſition, <hi>that it is not to be thought the holy Ghoſt aſſiſts any, that expoundes the Scripture contrary to the vniuerſall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church,</hi> the which I thinke too: and therefore this is not the point in queſtion; <q>when we both agree: but the point is, whether theſe <hi>priuate men,</hi> and ſpirits, being expounded to be Luther, &amp; ſuch as he was, with the Churches that caſt off the Papacy: &amp; this <hi>Catholicke,</hi> and <hi>vniuerſall Chriſtian Church,</hi> being expounded (as it is by our aduerſary) to be the Papacy, or Roman Church: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whether the priuate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany may not haue Gods Spirit, and the great company want it: and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, the ſaid <hi>priuate company</hi> be able to haue the truth againſt that, which A.

Firſt, <hi>No man, or company of men, beleeuing, and expounding the Scripture contrary to that which the vniuerſall Church, in the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:20570:175"/> firſt ſence, hath alway beleeued and expounded, can be aſſured they haue the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit;</hi> but the contrary, they may aſſure themſelues they are led by the ſpirit of error. The reaſon is; for no truth can be reuealed to any, but that which is in this Church; for if it be not in it, ſo that the Church neuer knew or beleeued it, then it cannot be the truth. For
<note n="q" place="margin">1. Tim. 3.15.</note> the Church is <hi>the pillar and ground of truth:</hi> and ſo a priuate man holding it, muſt needs hold an error. Secondly, <hi>A pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man, and priuate companies of men, may be, and many times are ſo aſſiſted by the holy Ghoſt, that they may beleeue, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the Scripture truly, againſt a particular Church or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Biſhops, either generall or particular.</hi> The reaſon is: for God hath left his truth with his Church, therein to remaine for euer; but not infallibly euery parcell of his truth, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery part, or aſſembly of the Church. But his prouidence, and promiſes to his Church, are ſufficiently vpholden, if he ſo ſupport the true faith, that it alway remaine in ſome of the Church. Therefore a particular Church or councell of Biſhops, may at ſome time, and in ſome points erre: and then it cannot be denied, but others may ſee the truth againſt them: this propoſition our aduerſaries dare not denie, nor do not. Thirdly, <hi>a priuate man, and priuate companies of men beleeuing and expounding the Scripture, onely againſt the Papacie, may be infallibly aſſured they are aſſiſted by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe this Papacie is no part of Gods truth, but the late inuentions of men added vnto it. Fourthly, <hi>Priuate men, and priuate companies of men, beleeuing and expounding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the Papacie, reſiſt not the true Church of Chriſt, nor any part of it.</hi> The reaſon is: for the Papacie being nothing elſe but a diſeaſe or excrement breeding in the Church, muſt not be expounded to be <hi>the Church it ſelfe:</hi> as a wenne or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie growing on the bodie, is not the bodie it ſelfe; and he that cuts off the wen, or purges away the leproſie, cannot be ſaid to reſiſt or wrong the bodie.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Theſe foure propoſitions thus laid downe, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt my aduerſarie doth but cauill in this place. For if his concluſion intended no more, but that priuate men muſt not
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:20570:176"/> be thought to know the truth, and <hi>the true Catholick Church</hi> to be in error, no man would ſpeake againſt him. But the ſence of his concluſion is againſt the three laſt of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions: That no man can be thought inſpired of God, or to haue the truth, when he expounds Scripture (as Luther and his did) contrary to the church of Rome: in which ſence onely I diſpute againſt him, and in no other. Not affirming that priuate men may ſee the truth, and the <hi>Catholicke vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall</hi> Church not ſee it; but onely that priuate men belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing contrary to that which my aduerſarie <hi>meanes</hi> by the Catholicke vniuerſall Church, may haue the truth on their ſide, and be infallibly ſure therof, without holding any thing contrary to the <hi>vnamine interpretation</hi> of the precedent or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Paſtors of the ſound part of the Catholicke Church.</p>

                     <q>A.D. To the reaſon alledged by me, and namely to that point of it, wherein I ſay,
<note place="margin">Pag. 200.</note> that <hi>a priuate man, who preſuming to be inſpired by the ſpirit, doth oppoſe himſelfe against the Church, neither can know himſelfe, or can aſſure others, that his ſpirit is infallible:</hi> M.

Now they that be thus aſſured, are infallibly ſure they be taught by the holy Ghoſt: for all Scripture is inſpired of God, and containeth the teaching of the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                        <pb n="307" facs="tcp:20570:176"/> To this I reply, asking how in particular, Luther (for example) could by Scripture aſſure himſelfe or others, that he was taught by the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God?</hi> It ſeemeth by M. Whites anſwer, that this aſſurance came by this or the like Syllogiſme: <hi>Whatſoeuer is taught by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is infallibly taught by the Spirit of God. But I Luther am taught by Scripture this and that point, viz. that I am iustified by onely Faith, &amp;c. Ergo, I</hi> (Luther) <hi>am infallibly aſſured, and may aſſure others, that in theſe points of doctrine, although contrary to the doctrine of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall viſible Church, I am taught by the Spirit of God.</hi> But who ſeeth not the weakneſſe of this proofe, when all the certaintie thereof is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reſolued into Luthers <hi>owne priuate and particular</hi> iudgement, in his owne caſe? which cannot be proued to be infallible, by ſaying, he was aſſiſted in his iudgement by the Spirit of God; but by begging the queſtion, and ſuppoſing that which is the point, that needeth moſt proofe, to wit, that he is in thoſe points <hi>taught by the Scripture,</hi> or that he is <hi>aſſiſted by the Spirit,</hi> to interprete aright. He iudged ſo: it is true: but his iudgement is fallible, and is ſo much the more to be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to be falſe, by how much he did prize and ouerweene his owne iudgement in his owne cauſe, when with intollerable pride he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it ſo contemptuouſly before the iudgement of <hi>a thouſand Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines and Cyprians,</hi> and of other moſt worthy and learned Doctors of the Catholicke Church.</q>

If it be demanded, how the Proteſtants can giue infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible aſſurance to others, that they vnderſtand the Scripture aright? I anſwer, that the ſame queſtion is to be made to the Papiſts: and both they and we muſt anſwer, that <hi>vnleſſe God illuminate their hearts, we can giue no aſſurance,</hi> neither they by the Church, nor we by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scripture: but ſuch as haue this illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, do ſee manifeſtly the truth of the things they haue beleeued. But Luther, he ſayes, <hi>held againſt the vniuerſall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church.</hi> I anſwer, and let all Papiſts well conſider of it, that they muſt proue this, which I call the Papacie, to be the vniuerſall Catholicke Church; afore they can ſay, Luther was deceiued. That, they cannot proue, but by the Scripture, in which triall Luther ſhall retire to the Scripture, no faſter then themſelues; and then they may be deceiued as well as Luther, in as much (vnleſſe they will runne in a round) as all their other authoritie, proofes, and motiues, muſt be tried by the Scriptures; OVER WHICH GOD HATH SET NO VISIBLE IVDGE IN THIS WORLD, THAT CAN IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FALLIBLY CONVINCE AND PERSWADE ALL MEN. I wil make this plaine, by laying downe the maner how Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and how a Papiſt aſſures himſelfe. Luther, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants for their part, beleeue, for example, that a man is iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by faith onely, becauſe the Scripture in plaine places excluding workes, and propoſing Gods free grace in Chriſt,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:20570:178"/> and maintaining the ſole merits of Chriſt, applied by faith, debarres euery thing from iuſtifying, that is in our ſelues; and ſo teaches expreſly, that we are iuſtified onely by faith in Chriſt. The Papiſts hold the contrary, alledging the Church and the Pope, whoſe doctrine, they ſay, it is, that we are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by our workes. But being demanded, how we know infallibly, that the Church or the Pope hath not erred in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo, they grant they may erre, and anſwer, that yet they are known not to erre in this point, by the Scriptures; which Scripture, and the true ſence thereof, is knowne and beleeued for it ſelfe. Here they are fallen into the ſame iſſue that the Proteſtants are, <hi>I am taught this by the Scripture.</hi> Now if they reply, that we are infallibly aſſured the Scripture is meant as we ſay, becauſe the <hi>Church</hi> expounds it ſo; who ſees not that they make a circle, thus to beleeue the <hi>Church</hi> firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the <hi>Scripture;</hi> and then againe to beleeue the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Church?</hi> Their maine reſolution therfore is the euidence and authoritie of the Scripture perſwading them, both that the doctrine is true, and that the Church which teaches it, is the true Church. And ſo they lie open to the ſame cauils that are made againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. <hi>Luther in vnderſtanding the Scripture, may be deceiued:</hi> ſo may they. <hi>It is Luthers own cauſe:</hi> ſo is this the Papiſts. <hi>Luthers iudgment is to be ſuſpected,</hi> when he preferred himſelf before the iudgement of the Church. The ſame ſay we to them, They preferre their iudgement before the Church, and all the Fathers: in as much as we can ſhew the Church and Fathers to be againſt them: and themſelues profeſſe, that the Popes authoritie is aboue both Church and Fathers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Indeed if M. Luther had had a thouſand Auſtins and Cyprians, and other Fathers of the Church, with <hi>one conſent,</hi> and <hi>plainly</hi> againſt him, he had bin ſo much the more to be ſuſpected, (for this is one maine thing, that makes vs abhorre the preſent Roman Church, becauſe it prefers it ſelfe and the Popes determination before all the Doctors in the world) but he neuer thought ſo, nor ſaid ſo.

                  <p n="4">4 I neuer intended, that any man could haue infallible aſſurance of that he beleeues, onely by Scripture interpreted by <hi>his owne priuate iudgement:</hi> all that I affirme, is, that priuate men may examine any doctrine that is publickly taught by whoſoeuer; and by <hi>Scripture alone,</hi> as by a certaine rule, they may be aſſured of the truth.

Not the Scripture <hi>alone,</hi> excluding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>meanes,</hi> whereby God makes the ſenſe thereof knowne; but <hi>the Scripture alone, as the rule</hi> of faith, excluding all authoritie of the Church and Paſtors.

<note place="margin">Intro. q. 3.</note> according to that which I noted in the Introduction, whereas alſo in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of theſe ſenſes it may be taken, either as it is generally in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or as it is particularly in this, or that determinate age, my Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, omitting all other ſenſes, principally vnderſtand me to meane, by the name Church, <hi>the Pope,</hi> or <hi>Paſtours of this preſent age,</hi> whereas in this Chapter, I do not, at leaſt <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> or primarily intend to ſpeake of the Church in this ſenſe: but rather do ſpeake of the Church in a more generall, indefinite, and indeterminate ſenſe, as it ſignifieth one, or other companie of men liuing, either in all ages, or in one, or other, age, who in one or other ſenſe may be called the Church; the doctrine whereof, ſay I, is the rule, and meanes ordained by God to inſtruct all ſorts of men in all matters of faith. Note ſecondly that by the doctrine of the Church, I do not vnderſtand, any <hi>Friars dreames,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">White pag. 3</note> as M. White dreameth, nor <hi>humane traditions,</hi> eſpecially oppoſite to Scripture, but diuine doctrine: including therein both the <hi>written diuine Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>vnwritten diuine traditions,</hi> and the true diuine <hi>interpretation</hi> of them both, as by word, writing, ſignes, or otherwiſe it is, or may be propounded, and deliuered to vs, by the authority of the Church: all which (although it may worthily be called <hi>diuine doctrine,</hi> as being firſt reuealed by God) here I call <hi>Church-doctrine,</hi> becauſe as it was firſt reuealed, and committed to the keeping of Prophets, and Apoſtles, who in their time, were chiefe, and principall members of the militant Church, ſo by Gods ordinance, it was to be propounded, and
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:20570:185"/> deliuered to other men, by the ſame Prophets, Apoſtles, and others their ſucceſſors, as they are Doctors, and Paſtors of the ſame Church. Note thirdly, that by the rule of faith, I meane ſuch a rule, as is alſo a ſufficient outward meanes, ordained, and ſet apart by God, to inſtruct all ſorts of men, in all points of faith; which conſequently muſt haue thoſe three conditions, or properties of the rule, ſet downe, and declared in the ſixt Chapter, viz that it muſt be <hi>infallible, eaſie</hi> to be vnderſtood of all ſorts, and <hi>vniuerſall,</hi> or ſuch as may ſufficiently reſolue one in all points of faith. Note fourthly, that when I ſay, the doctrine of the Church is the rule of faith, I do not vnderſtand, that the doctrine, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the Church, or the Church, as diuided from the doctrine, is the rule of ſaith, but that <hi>the doctrine as deliuered by the Church,</hi> or <hi>the Church as deliuering doctrine</hi> is that rule, and meanes which God hath ordained to inſtruct men in faith; Note fifthly, that to proue the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church to be the rule of faith, in ſuch ſort as now I haue ſaid, it might ſuffice for this Chapter, that it be ſhewed, that at leaſt once, or in one age, there were one, or other company of liuing men, in one or other ſenſe, called the Church, who were ordained by God, and ſet apart to inſtruct all ſorts of men in all points of faith, being for that purpoſe in their doctrine, and teaching, furniſhed with theſe three conditions, which are requiſite in the rule of faith; for this being ſhewed in this Chapter, I ſhall eaſily ſhew in the next, that the ſame is to be ſaid of ſome, or other company, continuing in all ages. In this Chapter therefore I chiefly vndertake to proue, that once, or in one age, there was a company of liuing men, who in one ſenſe may be called the Church, whom God ſpecially appointed, as a meanes ſufficient <hi>(quantu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ex ſe)</hi> to inſtruct all men, in all matters of faith, being for that purpoſe, furniſhed with the three conditions, or properties of the rule of faith.</q>

               <p n="1">1 THe concluſion of this Chapter was, that <hi>the infallible rule, which we ought obediently to follow in all points of faith, is the doctrine, and teaching faith, and beleefe of the true Church:</hi> his meaning wherein, he ſaies, I would not, or did not <hi>rightly vnderſtand.</hi> Let vs therefore ſee, how I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it. My anſwer was, that we would freely grant this concluſion, if the meaning were no more, but that <hi>the doctrine and faith of the vniuerſall Church, is the rule of faith, but there is a higher matter meant. Firſt that the Churches word, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, without grounding the ſame on the Scripture, is the rule. Next that the Church of Rome, is this vniuerſall Church. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that all the authority, and efficacy of the Church, is in the Pope
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:20570:185"/> alone.</hi> And this to be the meaning, I ſhewed in the 16. Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whereto the Repiar hath wiſely holden his tongue.

For
<note n="a" place="margin">The WAY pag. 68.</note> I ſhewed out of the Rhemiſts, Briſto, Poſſeuin, and Baron. that they admit no Catholicke Church, but the Romane onely: then aske him finally, how a man may know, which is the doctrine, and teaching, faith, and beleefe of the Church, and he will ſay againe (as I ſhewed fully) that WHAT THE POPE IVDICIALLY DETERMINES, AND PROPOVNDS TO THE CHVRCH, is it. Did I therefore miſtake, when he ſaid, that by the Church, he meant onely the Pope: or was not himſelfe rather vnable to defend the matter; and therefore would auoid the very point of the queſtion? Did I not alleadge 9. Papiſts, that all ſay, the whole power, and faculty of the Church, is in the Pope? Are not Gregory of Valenzaes

               <p n="2">2 Neuertheleſſe, not anſwering theſe things, when I obiected them, he notes fiue things for the vnderſtanding of his concluſion. Which I anſwer in order.

<note n="e" place="margin">Pag. 75.</note> in his Introduction, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he referres himſelfe, hauing ſaid, that the name Church may be taken 4 <hi>waies: either for the whole company of Chriſtian profeſſors, conſiſting of ſheepe, and Paſtors; or for the more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall part, to wit, the whole company of Paſtors, either gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a Councell, or diſperſed through the world: or for Chriſts Vicar, the Pope, as he hath moſt ample authority, either alone, or with a Councell, to propound the doctrine of faith: or for euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Paſtor, as he is authorized vnder the Pope, to feede the flocke committed to him:</hi> he concludes, that <hi>when he ſaies, Church propoſition is neceſſary, it is not needfull for him to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, which of theſe waies, he takes it, becauſe</hi> we the Proteſtants, <hi>deny any ſuch infallible authority to be in the Church at all, in which ſenſe ſoeuer he take it:</hi> whereby it is plaine, that he was aſhamed to name in which ſenſe, he takes the Church. For albeit we deny that which he cals the <hi>infallible authoritie</hi> of his Church (all ſupreme, and vnerring authoritie, being in the <hi>Scripture alone</hi>) yet the conſtant, and certaine doctrine of the Church taken in the two firſt ſenſes, we allow to be the rule of faith, becauſe it is onely the contents of the Scripture, as
<note n="f" place="margin">The WAY § 13. n. 1.</note> I anſwered to his concluſion: but that he means the Church in the third ſenſe alone appeares by this alſo, that it is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple among the Ieſuits, that the Church, in the firſt, ſecond,

For elſe how ſhould a man be able to diſtinguiſh thoſe points, wherein he muſt follow his teachers, from thoſe wherein he muſt not?</hi> And indeed this reaſon is vnanſwerable. For if our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath bound me to heare them, that ſit in Moſes chaire, <hi>no further</hi> then they teach true doctrine, <hi>according to the chaire,</hi> it muſt neceſſarily be ſaid, that there is ſome rule, <hi>diſtinct</hi> from their teaching, whereby I may infallibly diſcerne, if they teach falſely againſt the chaire. But the Reply ſayes <hi>this needs not;</hi> it being ſufficient, that we can diſtinguiſh two manners of teaching: the one <hi>Priuate,</hi> and without authority, which we are not bound to accept: the other <hi>publicke,</hi> and with authoritie, which we may not reiect in any point. But for the making of this diſtinction, it needes that there be a rule: for though it be ſufficient thus to <hi>diſtinguiſh,</hi> that is to ſay, by diſcerning, and iudging, betweene that which is taught by publicke, and that which is taught by priuate authoritie, a man may ſufficiently guide himſelfe in following his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors: yet how ſhall I <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> this? which way ſhall I know the <hi>publicke</hi> teaching from the <hi>priuate</hi> without A RVLE? Say plainely what is the RVLE to diſcerne that doctrine, which is taught <hi>without authority,</hi> from that which is taught <hi>with authoritie?</hi> and if there be ſuch a rule, ſay againe, whether it be not ſomething <hi>diſtinct</hi> from the <hi>teaching,</hi> and <hi>authority,</hi> of the teachers? for ſo much as that <hi>wherby</hi> the teaching, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is diſcerned, and tried, cannot be confounded with the teaching: and if there be ſuch a diſtinct rule, what can it be, but the Scripture, which onely is the thing, that all Church teaching muſt agree with? Thus therefore I reaſon <hi>ad hominem. In the doctrine taught by the Paſtours of the Church it ſufficeth, that I can diſtinguiſh the priuate from the publicke; that which is taught with authority, from that, which is without autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Therefore</hi> I MAY, <hi>yea muſt thus diſtinguiſh. I may</hi> DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STINGVISH,

For although it be true that the ſame Church, which I ſpeake of, be the Church, or part of the Church ſpoken of in the Creed: although alſo it be the Church militant, or part of the Church militant, containing as part of it, all profeſſours, good, and bad: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard I hold (as all good Chriſtians ſhould) that there is but one Church:
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:20570:198"/> yet that I may cut off occaſions of cauill, I will not now diſpute, what is meant by the word Church, as it is in the Creed, or whether the Church militant be that Church, which I ſay is viſible: I onely aske, whether the Church of which I ſpake in the two precedent Chapters, <hi>whoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is</hi> there proued, by diuers places of Scriptures, to be in all ages <hi>the Rule,</hi> and meanes, ordained by God to inſtruct all men, in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith: whether (I ſay) this Church be in all ages viſible, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inuiſible?

                     <hi>The onely reaſon, and ground by which heretickes hold the Church to

<note n="b" place="margin">Ibi.</note> I anſwered, that this was not our reaſon, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could be, for that in this queſtion we ſpeake not of the vniuerſall Church, comprehending none but the elect of all times, and ages, but of the Church for the time being wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the true faith is remaining, which Church containes hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites alſo, and euill men, as well as good. Wherein I ſpake effectually: for his owne words are, that <hi>the queſtion is of the militant Church.</hi> And when our doctrine is, that the militant Church conſiſts of wicked reprobates, as well as elect, how can we make it a ground to proue it inuiſible ſometime, becauſe it conſiſts onely of the elect? Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in this place, you ſee he complaines of my <hi>peruerting</hi> the ſtate of the queſtion, and denies that he <hi>meant it,</hi> as I tooke it: Let vs therefore ſee, what he requires, and if his <hi>meaning be miſtaken,</hi> good reaſon he explaine himſelfe, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene vs be agreed vpon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Firſt he ſaies, that he enquires, in generall, not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>the Church mentioned in the Creed,</hi> or whether the <hi>militant</hi> Church be viſible, but whether <hi>that Church whoſe teaching we ought to follow,</hi> be alwaies viſible: that is, ſuch, as <hi>may be ſeene,</hi> or by ſeeking found? And I alſo ſaid,
<note n="*" place="margin">In what ſenſe the militant Church is by the Proteſtant Diuines, ſaid to be ſometime inuiſible.</note> the queſtion is onely of the outward ſtate of the Church, whether it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way viſible to the world, or not; that in euery age thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations may euidently be diſcerned, and pointed too, which are the true Church. Not affirming the true outward militant Church at any time hitherto to haue bin inuiſible:<q>for the viſible Churches of Greece, Ethiope, Armenia, and Rome, with the nations contained therein, haue in them the true Church of God, wherein men may be ſaued: but onely intending that there is not alway, in this Church a viſible company, and ſtate of people, <hi>deuided from the reſt that profeſſe the true faith, and exercize Church gouernement, in all things free from the corruptions, and abuſes of ſuch, as haue defiled the Church.</hi> And thus I neuer denied the Church of Rome to be
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:20570:199"/> the viſible Church of God, wherein our Aunceſtors poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the true faith, and were ſaued: but I conſtantly deny the PAPACY to be it: or the ARTICLES wherein we refuſe the Church of Rome, to be the faith thereof: and affirme the ſame to be a Leproſie breeding in the Church ſo vniuerſally that there was no viſible companie of people appearing to the world free from it: and whether any company at all, knowne, or vnknowne were free from it <hi>wholy,</hi> or not, I neither determine, nor greatly care. All that I hold touching the inuiſible Church, being, that the true Church being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne with hereſie, and corruption, there hath not at all times bene therein a diſtinct company, to be ſeene, which in all points were free from the corruption: though there may be ſhewed a company that held all the ſubſtantiall points, ſimply neceſſary to ſaluation.</q> Had the Ieſuite vnderſtood my words in this ſenſe, which I often declared, all ouer my Booke, he would neuer haue trifled away time in prouing the Church, <hi>whoſe doctrine is the rule,</hi> to be <hi>viſible,</hi> which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not; but he would haue gone roundly to worke, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the viſible Church to be neuer ſo corrupted, but there is ſome one or more ſpeciall companies therein, viſibly to be ſeene by all, and ſeparated from the reſt, that is not defiled with the corruption. For the Church is viſible to be ſeene at all time, more, or leſſe, whoſe teaching, in the ſound part thereof, is to be followed to the worlds ende. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe firſt he excepts, that I ſay, <hi>the queſtion is of the Church militant,</hi> containing as part of it, euill men, and hypocrites: <hi>whereas to ſpeake preciſely, he makes not the Queſtion, that way; but to cut off occaſions of cauill, he ſaies he deſputes, whether the Church, whereof he spake in the precedent Chapters, whoſe doctrin in all ages is the rule of faith;</hi> whether, <hi>I ſay, this Church be in all ages viſible, or ſometimes inuiſible?</hi> as if the Church whoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is the rule in all ages, were any other then the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant? His concluſions, whereby he taught his friend, how to reſolue himſelfe in religion, were theſe: That <hi>there is a rule left by God,</hi> whereby all men may be inſtructed. <hi>This rule is not the Scripture, but the doctrin of the true Church, which Church
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:20570:199"/> is alway viſible:</hi> that all men, at all times, may ſee it; wherein, he affirmes, as I do, the militant Church to be viſible, becauſe that onely is it, that mortall men can heare, and haue acceſſe to, and this I ſhew diſtinctly to be the queſtion. For firſt, his owne expreſſe words are:
<note n="c" place="margin">In THE WAY pag 99.</note> 
                     <hi>It is euident, that the Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant conſiſts of good and bad;</hi> but this Church conſiſting of good and bad, is the ſame that before in his concluſion he affirmed to be viſible, confuting our (ſuppoſed) ground wherupon we held it inuiſible. Secondly, in this very paſſage he ſayes, it is true, that the ſame Church he ſpeakes of, is the Church <hi>militant, or part of it.</hi> Thirdly, he expounds himſelfe to meane that Church, whoſe doctrine is the rule to teach vs. But the doctrine of no Church teaches vs, but that of the Militant liuing here vpon earth, where they that liue are taught. Fourthly, he meanes that Church whereto euery one may haue acceſſe, and repaire for inſtruction; whereto alſo they may ioine themſelues, and wherein they may admoniſh their brethren: and therefore preciſely he ſpeakes of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant church vpon earth: and his words, that <hi>to ſpeake pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely,</hi> he <hi>makes not the queſtion this way,</hi> but onely askes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church, whoſe doctrine is the rule, be viſible, are ſo <hi>preciſe,</hi> that a man would think his head-peece were not wel ſeaſoned; when either he muſt grant this his viſible Church to be militant, or confeſſe it to be none of Gods Church: for ſo much as all the Church of God, <hi>whoſe doctrine is the rule of faith,</hi> is, for the time being, militant here on earth, and part of that which is mentioned in the Creed, where we ſay, <hi>credo Eccleſiam.</hi> Therefore the queſtion betweene vs is, whether the companie of thoſe that profeſſe and teach the true faith of Chriſt, without mixture of corruption, among whom poſſible many hypocrites and wicked men liue, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie is called the Militant-church, be at all times viſible? The Reply ſayes it is, and muſt no more denie his aſſertion to be meant euen <hi>preciſely</hi> of this companie.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 His ſecond exception is about the words <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>inuiſible,</hi> where he ſayes fiue things. Firſt, that by a viſible Church, I make him to mean a company alway ſo illuſtrious,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:20570:200"/> that it <hi>may</hi> be knowne to all men, liuing at all times. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I make him to meane this companie alſo to be ſo il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious, that <hi>actually it is</hi> thus knowne. Thirdly, that he meanes not the word viſible in this <hi>ſecond</hi> ſence. Fouthly, that he knowes the Church is ſometime <hi>obſcured,</hi> and ſhines not <hi>actually</hi> through the whole world. Fiftly, that the Church is alway viſible in this ſence, that alway, euen in the greateſt obſcuritie, it hath <hi>ſome eminent profeſſors,</hi> which either are actually knowne, or may in particular be aſſigned. The firſt is true, for he ſayes it expreſly in the laſt. And I ſuppoſe he will not denie it, when ſo many of his owne Diuines hold it. Dom. Bannes

                     <hi>Our aſſertion is, that in all ages there may euidently be ſeene and diſcerned, and as it were pointed out with the finger, a companie of men, whereof euery one may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that it is the true Church.</hi> The ſecond is falſe. For though it follow manifeſtly vpon his words, and that which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines of his church teach of the viſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>leneſſe of their church; yet I charged him not ſo farre: but contented my ſelfe with confuting that which is contained in his firſt and laſt aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Neuertheleſſe it is true, that he and all Papiſts muſt by their owne principles, hold the Church to be euen <hi>actually</hi> viſible to all men. For he ſayes,
<note n="g" place="margin">Repl. p. 170.</note> God hath giuen ſufficient meanes to <hi>all men</hi> for their ſaluation:
<note n="h" place="margin">In THE WAY §. 13.</note> and <hi>the teaching</hi> of this his church, is the meanes. But no meanes is ſufficient, that is not <hi>actually</hi> reuealed: as
<note n="i" place="margin">Ch. 25. n. 15.16.</note> I haue ſhewed heretofore out of the Repliers owne authors. Therefore if <hi>ſufficient</hi> meanes be onely that which is <hi>actually</hi> reuealed, and the Church be the meanes, it followes, the Church muſt be <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> viſible: or elſe let vs ſee how the Replier will quit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. The third is alſo falſe, as I haue ſaid: but yet allowing it to be true, I haue not <hi>peruerted</hi> the queſtion; becauſe I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and diſpute againſt the viſibleneſſe of the Church in that ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nce which he holds in the firſt and laſt aſſertion. The fourth I accept as the truth, and haue ſhewed in
<note n="k" place="margin">Digr. 17.</note> THE WAY,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:20570:200"/> that as his owne Diuines expound it, it vtterly deſtroyes his firſt and laſt aſſertions, and yeelds as much as we ſay, that <hi>the Church free from groſſe and foule corruptions, is not alway to be ſeene where or in whom it is.</hi> Whereto if you adde that which

The laſt, is enough to ſhew, that I peruert not the queſtion. For I denie, and ſhewed in my anſwers to all his arguments, that howſoeuer the Church conſiſts of men that <hi>may be</hi> ſeene, and theſe men <hi>know</hi> one another where they liue; yet there is no ſuch <hi>eminencie</hi> in any of them, that the world can tell who or where they be that in the Church hold the true faith without corruption; but they may be ſo hidden by perſecutions &amp; hereſies increaſing in the church, that no man ſhall diſcerne them, and that they can haue no open or vncorrupted exerciſe of religion: wherein I haue ſhewed, our aduerſaries themſelues, driuen by the neceſſitie of the truth, to come home to vs. Digreſſ. 17.</p>

                     <q>A.D. This my concluſion thus declared and proued,
<note place="margin">Pag. 237.</note> doth fore pinch my aduerſaries, and putteth them to pitifull ſtraits, as after we ſhall ſee. For on the one ſide, to denie the Church, <hi>in ſuch ſence as here I haue declared,</hi> to be at all times <hi>viſible,</hi> without impudencie they cannot, my proofes (at leaſt ſome of them) are ſo apparent and plaine: on the other ſide to grant it to be in this ſence alwayes <hi>viſible,</hi> they will not, for feare that people do thereby plainly ſee, that Proteſtants (who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſſigne a continuall viſible Church, or a companie of profeſſors of their faith, nor ſo much as one profeſſing Proteſtant in euery ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall age ſince Chriſt) cannot be the true Church, of which onely, as of the ordinarie rule and meanes, all men muſt learne, what is, and what is not to be holden for the true ſauing faith. My aduerſaries therefore not daring (as it may ſeeme) to make direct anſwer,
<note place="margin">White, p. 100. Wotton, p. 210.</note> and yet being willing at leaſt to make ſhew of an anſwer, do diſtinguiſh two ſeuerall Churches, that when they are hunted out of one, they may runne into the other, and that being purſued thither, they may for refuge flie into the former: they call one Church the true <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke</hi> Church, ſpoken of in the Creed, which they affirme to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine onely the elect; to whom (as they ſay) belong the promiſes of the Spirit, which in Scripture were made to the Church. This Church, both my aduerſaries do account <hi>ſimply inuiſible.</hi> And truly ſince no man can tell who be Gods elect, if they could as well proue, as they boldly affirme, that the Church (ſpoken of in the Creed, or in thoſe places of Scripture, where the promiſes of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are made to the Church) doth containe none but the elect; it could not be denied, that it were <hi>inuiſible.</hi> But this they will neuer be able ſufficiently to proue. The other Church which they diſtinguiſh from the Catholicke Church, M. White calleth the Church <hi>militant,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">White, p. 100. Wotton. p. 210.</note> containing as part of it, all profeſſors of the true faith, whether good or bad, beleeuers or hypocrites, elect or reprobate. The neceſſitie which driueth them to admit ſuch a Church, is (as I gueſſe) becauſe if no companie of men did in any ſort pertaine to the Church, but onely the elect, whom none can know; it would follow, that ſince (as hath bene proued) no man can ordinarily attaine true faith, but by inſtruction receiued from the true Church; euery man ordinarily might deſpaire of attaining true faith, and conſequently of attaining ſaluation, which is not had without true faith, in regard he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer know the companie or Church to whom he muſt repaire for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in faith.

I alledged the confeſſions of diuers Papiſts, in the 17. Digr. why hath he not anſwered thereto, and ſhewed what or how they ſay leſſe then we? Next he ſhewes what <hi>the ſtrait</hi> is, we are put to. For <hi>on the one ſide,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>it is impudencie to denie his concluſion, ſo apparently proued: on the other ſide, we dare not grant it for feare of the people.</hi> Here is neuer a true word. Firſt his concluſion is not <hi>proued.</hi> For the arguments which he propounded to demonſtrate it, he hath not followed, nor vpholden; but leauing them in the field behind him, he runs away, without ſo much as looking behind him, and in all his Reply reſcues not one of them. Secondly, his concluſion is iuſtly denied, and without <hi>impudencie:</hi> for it is no <hi>impudencie</hi> to denie that which cannot be proued; but it is <hi>impudencie</hi> to require men to beleeue that which hath no proofe. He ſpeakes of his <hi>proofes,</hi> as he doth of his Church, all is <hi>eminent, illuſtrous, apparent, plaine, viſible to all,</hi> when yet no man ſees them. Thirdly, the <hi>reaſon</hi> why we grant not the Church to be in his ſence viſible, is not for <hi>feare of the people,</hi> nor becauſe we cannot giue the Profeſſors of our faith <hi>in euery age;</hi> but becauſe it is the truth, which with all his boaſting he cannot remoue: for albeit the Church neuer failes, but abides per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually viſible in ſome degree to the end; yet is there not alway therein a viſible companie, by profeſſion and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, diſtinct from the reſt, that is free from the generall corruption that preuailes in the Church of which company onely the queſtion is. He maintaining that the Church <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre,</hi> nor be ſubiect to any ſuch corruption, but hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in it <hi>eminent profeſſors,</hi> and <hi>ſpeciall congregations,</hi> that are neuer infected with any part of the corruption, nor need
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:20570:203"/> reformation: which perſons and congregations appeare as viſibly and diſtinctly to all men, as worldly kingdomes are diſtinctly ſeene and knowne: and we holding the Church to be <hi>perpetuall,</hi> onely becauſe there are alway in the world which hold the true worſhip of God; and to be <hi>viſible</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it may at all times be ſeene, though hereſie may ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and perſecution ſo ariſe, that a viſible companie ſhall not appeare, which is not in ſome meaſure touched with the common errors; or needs not repentance and reformation. All which is ſo true, that I challenge the Replier, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the zealouſeſt of my aduerſaries to ſay ingenuouſly, if the learned Papiſts alledged Digreſſ. 17. ſay not, in effect, as much themſelues.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Our anſwer therefore is direct and plaine, both to the <hi>concluſion</hi> and the <hi>reaſons;</hi> and ſo direct, that the Ieſuite hath no ſtomack to reply: but exceeding groſly &amp; falſly, expounds &amp; affixes a meaning to vs, that we neuer meant. Firſt he ſays, we diſtinguiſh <hi>two ſeuerall Churches,</hi> whereof we call the one the <hi>Catholicke</hi> Church mentioned in the Creed, containing onely the elect: the other the <hi>Militant</hi> Church, containing as part of the Catholick, the profeſſors of the true faith, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or bad, beleeuers or hypocrites, elect or repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Next he ſayes, <hi>the reaſon</hi> why we thus diſtinguiſh two ſeuerall Churches, is, that <hi>when we are hunted out of the one, we may runne into the other.</hi> This he expounds ſomething more plainly: <hi>That which, as I gueſſe</hi> (for he hath no certaintie of what he ſayes) <hi>driues them to admit ſuch a Church militant, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht from the Catholicke, is, leaſt if none ſhould be ſaid to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the Church, but onely the elect, it would follow, that men might deſpaire of attaining true faith, (which is not had but by the teaching of the Church) for as much as they could neuer know who are elected.</hi> Thirdly he ſays, this Militant Church, which other Proteſtants commonly call the viſible Church, <hi>M. White will needs defend to be ſometimes inuiſible.</hi> That theſe things may the better be vnderſtood, and anſwered: note FIRST, that by the word Church taken in his full latitude,
<note place="margin">The Church.</note> we meane the whole companie of all thoſe whom God calls to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:20570:204"/> and profeſſion of his truth, and ſo to ſaluation. Of which calling and ſeparation from the reſt of the world, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in Atheiſme and idolatry, without the knowledge or acceptation of thoſe ſupernatural verities that leade to God, it hath the denomination, and is called the Church; as if you ſhould ſay, a companie called or gathered forth of the reſt of the world.
<note place="margin">But one church</note> Note SECONDLY, that the Church abſolutely and ſimply conſidered in this latitude, is but <hi>One,</hi> as the ſtate and company of the kingdome of Great Brittain is but one; in as much as all and euery one called to this grace, of how diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtate, qualities, or condition ſoeuer, belong, one way or other, to this companie: for the faith being but one, and the maner of calling by reuealing the ſame but one: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies that receiue and profeſſe it, how many ſoeuer reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiuely, yet abſolutely, and abſtracting from particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of times and perſons, can be but one. Note THIRDLY, that in the Church, being abſolutely but one, there are ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry differences and reſpects; that is to ſay, the perſons called to the faith of Chriſt, are of diuers ſorts: as the kingdome of Great Brittain, being but one, yet is diuers waies conſidered. For ſome part of the Church being reduced from the ſtate of this mortall life, reignes with God in heauen, and is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with that glorie, whereto it was called when it was here on earth.
<note place="margin">The trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Church.</note> This we call the <hi>Triumphant</hi> Church, becauſe as tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphers they enioy the reward due to conquerers. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Church, is that which ſucceſſiuely in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, liues here in this world, profeſſing that it deſires to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Triumphant,
<note place="margin">The militant Church.</note> and enioy eternall life: this we call the Church <hi>Militant,</hi> becauſe it lies as it were in the campe, figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt the world, the diuell, and the fleſh, vnder the banner of Chriſt, waiting for the victorie. But among theſe againe there are two ſorts of people: the <hi>firſt,</hi> all ſuch as are called effectually:
<note place="margin">The Church of the elect.</note> theſe are the <hi>elect</hi> onely, whom God not onely calls, but inſpires alſo effectually to obey his calling, and to liue holy and vnblameable, in ſuch ſort, that they ſhal infallibly be ſaued in the life to come.
<note place="margin">The inuiſible Church.</note> This company we call the <hi>inuiſible</hi> Church, becauſe God onely ſees who are his; we
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:20570:204"/> can ſee the men, and by their fruits hope they are Gods elect; but to ſpeake preciſely, no mortall eie can diſcerne them to be Gods elect, but God alone: by reaſon hypocrites and the reprobate, do many times reſemble them in ſhew and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. The <hi>ſecond</hi> ſort of the Militant Church, are hypocrites and vnſound members, that are not called effectually, but diſobey the truth, whereof they make profeſſion, ſuch are heretickes, ſchiſmatickes, and all the wicked that will not obey the truth, whom we call the falſe and <hi>malignant</hi> church.
<note place="margin">The malignant Church.</note> Note FOVRTHLY, that howſoeuer the elect liuing here vpon earth, and effectually called, be inuiſible in the ſence deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; yet when we ſay <hi>the Church militant is ſometimes inuiſible,</hi> we meane it of the Church Militant that liues in the world, and outwardly profeſſes the faith of Chriſt, whether they therein that do it, be the <hi>elect</hi> or <hi>others:</hi> for we onely ſpeake of the place and companie, where the truth is profeſſed, and may be found, which may well be, where the wicked and the elect are mingled together. Note FIFTHLY, that the Church is called <hi>Catholick</hi> or vniuerſal in two ſences: firſt, the Church taken in his full latitude,
<note place="margin">Catholicke Church.</note> for <hi>the whole company</hi> of all that are called both in heauen and in earth, viſible and inuiſible, elect and hypocrites, is called the Catholicke Church, in as much as it comprehends all that haue bene called to the profeſſion of the Catholick faith: then againe, for ſo much as any part may ſynecdochically be termed after the name of the whole, it ſometimes fals out, that the <hi>Militant</hi> Church, or <hi>any part</hi> of it, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nd hereſies, that a true Church, entirely teaching the faith of Chriſt, without errors, and freely vſing the word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, apart from the reſt of the Church, cannot be ſeene in all the world. And our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries arguments being applied to this, neither <hi>hunt</hi> nor purſue vs ſo, but we can anſwer them without <hi>flying into the Church of the elect:</hi> for we do not ſay, that the elect alone are thus obſcured, but euen all, whether elect or reprobate, that openly hold the ſtate mentioned, in this ſence, that not onely the elect are inuiſible, not to be diſcerned with
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:20570:205"/> mortall eye; (for they are alwaies ſo in this world) but the whole Church Militant, containing both elect and others, is at ſome times ſo defaced and obſcured, that the world cannot ſee where the ſubſtance of faith is holden without errors mingled. And ſo it is meerly vntrue, that the Replier ſayes, touching our <hi>flying to the Church of the elect.</hi> For, as I anſwered in
<note n="e" place="margin">Pag. 100.</note> THE WAY, though we hold the Catholicke Church mentioned in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Creed, euery member whereof is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, to be inuiſible, becauſe God alone ſees who are elected, <hi>yet the Church thus conſidered, is not it that we ſpeake of in this queſtion,</hi> but the Militant; whereof we ſay, it IS ALWAY manifeſt to the world, but a companie therein, that needs not reformation, is NOT ALWAY manifeſt. And whereas he ſayes, we will neuer be able ſufficiently to proue, <hi>the Church ſpoken of in the Creed and in the Scripture, where the promiſes of the Spirit are made to the Church, to containe none but the elect,</hi> he is deceiued. For though this be not materiall to the point in hand, and (without any diſaduantage to our cauſe) might be granted, yet the beſt learned of his owne ſide, ſay as we do, that none are ſimply, abſolutely, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocally of the Church, but the elect alone, as I haue ſhewed immediatly before. For
<note n="f" place="margin">Eph. 5.23. Col. 1.18.</note> the Church being nothing elſe but <hi>the bodie</hi> of Chriſt, and Chriſt being <hi>the Sauiour of his bodie;</hi> how ſhall hypocrites and other euill men, whom he neuer ſaues, be truly ſaid to be his Church? And when

But, as I ſaid, this is not materiall to the point in hand, and therefore I will not diuert into it, our aſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſertion being, that not the elect alone are alway inuiſible, but ſometimes alſo all the congregations of the world wherein they liue and profeſſe Chriſt, are ſo corrupted or oppreſſed, that albeit the ſubſtance of ſauing faith, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:20570:206"/> in the Creed and rule of faith, be retained in them, yet there is no congregation viſible, that hath not diuers cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions needing reformation, hanging on them. And albeit we thus diſtinguiſh the <hi>Militant</hi> from the <hi>Catholick</hi> inuiſible Church of the elect, part whereof is alway in the Militant church; and one cauſe among many, be the ſame that the Replier hath aſſigned, <hi>leſt if none ſhould pertaine to the Church but the elect, men ſhould deſpaire of attaining the truth, (foraſmuch as it is not found but in the Church) becauſe they ſhould not be able to tell who are elect;</hi> yet that we ſay, is a direct anſwer to them, that bid vs aſſigne <hi>a continuall viſible Church profeſſing the Proteſtant religion:</hi> for we aſſigne and name, not the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of <hi>the elect,</hi> as the Replier abſurdly reports, but the <hi>Militant Church of Rome,</hi> that all men haue ſeene many ages together. But when they reply, that the Church of Rome differs from the Proteſtants in many points, then comes in that we ſay of the inuiſible ſtate of the Church, that the true Church of God, wherein ſaluation is to be found, may yet for ſome ſpace and diſtance of time, be ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with hereſie and perſecution, that no companie can be ſeene to beleeue and profeſſe in all things aright, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtles teaching, by reaſon of errors, either greater or leſſer, added to their Apoſtolicke faith; the which errors, when God giues libertie to remoue, that the rule of faith may be holden without them, then it may truly and directly be ſaid, the reformed Church that hath remoued theſe corruptions, for ſome ſpace in former times was inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:20570:207"/> that not onely the true Church, conſiſting in their opinion onely of <hi>the elect,</hi> is altogether inuiſible: but the other Church, which they grant to conſiſt of <hi>all Profeſſors</hi> of the faith, may ſometimes be inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: this aſſertion they maintaine, as it ſeemeth of purpoſe, that when after I ſhall vrge them, to aſſigne a continuall profeſſing Proteſtant companie, as we can ſhew a continuall companie of profeſſors of the Romane faith, they may by this ſtarting hole, of the <hi>inuiſibilitie</hi> or <hi>ſecretneſſe</hi> of the Church, eſcape away, without anſwering my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which can neuer be directly and ſufficiently anſwered.

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:20570:207"/> that the Church, conſiſting of profeſſors, ſometime is inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: that is to ſay, the whole number of true beleeuers, and profeſſors liuing in the world, which we call the Church Militant, ſometime looſe the outward conſpicuouſnes of Apoſtolicke doctrine, and gouernment free from abuſes, which the Papiſts ſay they alway hold. Touching this aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he notes two things:</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Firſt the reaſon why we maintaine it? <hi>That when he,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, <hi>ſhall afterwards vrge vs to aſſigne a continuall profeſſing Proteſtant company, as he can ſhew a continuall company of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, of the Roman faith: we may by this ſtarting hole, eſcape without anſwer.</hi> This is but winde, and oſtentation; he can ſhew no continuall company ſucceſſiuely, or viſibly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the Roman faith, with <hi>all</hi> the articles thereof, <hi>as now it is holden:</hi> he may ſet downe a catalogue of Biſhops, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Councels, and Profeſſors, that in all ages haue bene in the world, but that they beleeued as <hi>himſelfe,</hi> and the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,</hi> and his Romiſh Church <hi>now</hi> do, otherwiſe then in the ſubſtantiall articles of faith, wherein we agree with them: or that there were none among them that miſliking the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Papacy, as they grew, held in the ſubſtance of the Proteſtants religion, he can neuer <hi>ſhew,</hi> as will appeare. The true cauſe, why we maintaine the Church to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time inuiſible is this, that I ſhall lay downe.
<note n="*" place="margin">The manner how the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on touching the <hi>viſibility</hi> of the Church firſt began: and in what ſenſe</note> For when <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and the firſt <hi>Reformers,</hi> ſome hundred yeares agoe, withdrew themſelues from the ſubiection of the Pope, and put away theſe innumerable errors out of their Churches, which our Aduerſaries now maintaine againſt vs: <q>as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>image</hi> worſhip, <hi>Inuocation</hi> of Saints, <hi>Purgatory,</hi> the <hi>Maſſe, Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and the reſt wherein our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and we diſſent: altering nothing of that, which belongs to the ſubſtance of true faith, or which the Church of Rome had receiued from the Apoſtles, and Primitiue Church; but onely contrary to the cuſtomes of ſome ages before, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the ſame, without the mixture of the aforeſaid errors: the Pope, with his crew, cried out they were <hi>Heretickes,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting them with fire, and ſword, and charging them to
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:20570:208"/> haue forſaken the Church of Chriſt, wherein they ſhould be ſaued: and among other arguments, his Champions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to ſhew, the <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of their doctrine, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, boaſting that vnleſſe they could do it, and ſhew their Church to haue viſibly bene in all ages, they would conclude they had forſaken the Church, and were the firſt authors of the Proteſtant Religion. The Reformers to this anſwered, that THE CHVRCH OF ROME IT SELFE, was their viſible Church, wherein they were bred, and whence they proceeded: but therein was two kinds of Articles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The one, which was <hi>Apoſtolicke,</hi> and had bene from the beginning: the other that, which at ſeuerall times, by the <hi>faction,</hi> and conueiance of Hereticks had bene brought in, and mingled with the truth: this latter they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, but not the former; making it more then mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that in the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the truth, and <hi>rule of faith,</hi> taught by the Apoſtles, and certainely holden by the ancient Church, they had altered nothing, but onely ſeparated themſelues from intollerable corruptions, and from the Popes tyranny, that maintained, and vrged them: who by his tyranny, and peruerting all things, had declared himſelfe <hi>to be Antichriſt ſitting in the Church of God.</hi> And when the Papiſts ſtill cried, SHEW VS A VISIBLE CHVRCH IN ALL THE WORLD, PROFSSING IN ALL THINGS, AS YOV DO; they replied it was not neceſſary ſo to do. THE CHVRCH OF ROME IT SELFE, was the viſible Church, profeſſing as they did in all things ſubſtantiall. But if they required ſuch a Church as had put away thoſe errors, and held the ſubſtance without corruptions, and hereſies mingled among the Profeſſors; then ſuch a Church, was ſometime inuiſible: that is to ſay, it may ſometime fall out, that in all the world, no part of the Church ſhall be outwardly ſeene to hold the ſucceſſion of all the true faith without corruption, and the pureſt Profeſſors may be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that their memory ſhall be taken away; and that which is the worſt part of the Church ſhall be ſtrongeſt, and generally reputed moſt Catholicke.</q> This is the true, and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:20570:208"/> originall reaſon of this queſtion: whereby it is eaſie to ſee, that we neuer imagined the Church to be <hi>ſimply</hi> inuiſible at any time, but this inuiſibility hath bene affirmed onely of the outward ſtate thereof, at ſome times, when reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath not bene ſo pure, as now it is. No otherwiſe then I would ſay the body was inuiſible, when a Leproſie had ouergrowne it; or the kingdome of France were inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when tyranny, and new cuſtomes ſhould mingle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues therewith, and the ancient lawes be expounded by a faction of Rebels.</p>

                  <p n="5">5 His firſt reaſon is,
<note place="margin">Ad. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe the Church is bound by a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue precept, neuer to deny Chriſt, or his religion, or to abſtaine from the ſeruice and ceremonies thereof: but outwardly to profeſſe the faith.</hi> To this I anſwered in
<note n="b" place="margin">§. 19.</note> my Booke, that the Church neither failes to profeſſe outwardly the faith, which in heart it beleeues, nor yet is made viſible, and knowne to all, by this profeſſion. The reaſon is, becauſe the members of the Church profeſſing the ſubſtance of faith (as
<note n="c" place="margin">1. Reg. 19.18.</note> the 7000. in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael did, that <hi>bowed not the knee to Baal,</hi> whom Elias ſaw not) when perſecution, and preuailing error will not ſuffer them to do it in the pureſt manner in all points; yet this is outward profeſſion, and ſatisfies the commandement, which requires no more but 2. things, firſt, that we profeſſe openly to the world, as long as the ſame wil ſuffer vs; and be ready to ſeale the faith, thus profeſſed, with our bloud, when by neceſſary circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances of time, and place, we ſhall be called thereunto: ſecondly, that when perſecution, or inuincible ignorance, or any other impediment hinders that this cannot be done, yet we profeſſe one to another, and maintaine the faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, or how few ſoeuer, ſo farre as we haue meanes to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. To this my aduerſary replies, that <hi>indeede the rites, and ceremonies of ſeruice, and ſacraments,</hi> (whereby he meanes the profeſſion mentioned, in as much, as by the exercize of theſe things Chriſt is profeſſed) <hi>may,</hi> though hardly, <hi>be done in ſecret: but the Church is bound to another kind of actuall profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before the world.</hi> I anſwer 2. things. Firſt, himſelfe knew this abſolutely taken, to be falſe: and therefore he recalles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and yeeldes againe, that <hi>all the members of the Church are not bound at all times, actually to ſhine in this maner,</hi> but then, when Gods glory, and the good of ſoules, requires. This he borrowed of his Thomas, whoſe words ſhall be this part of
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:20570:214"/> my anſwer. For the Church and the ſeuerall members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are neuer ſo hidden, or ouerwhelmed with error, but in time, and place neceſſarily requiring the ſame, they profeſſe the ſubſtance euen outwardly, and ſuffer ſometime for the ſame: and thus did many profeſſe the Proteſtants faith in all ages: and therefore the Ieſuite trifles away the time, when he ſtandes to proue it neceſſary, that euen <hi>alway ſome or other ſhould profeſſe outwardly:</hi> for we graunt it, and that there are ſome <hi>eminent</hi> Chriſtians (if not in <hi>ſtate,</hi> yet in <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>truth</hi>) at all times: and theſe <hi>loue God, feare not the world,</hi> but <hi>regard his honour,</hi> and <hi>deſire to publiſh his truth:</hi> and what yee will: and yet ſtill theſe men may be oppreſſed with ſome corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and hindered by perſecution, that few can marke, or diſcerne them, and ſo contemptible in the world, that the moſt will not beleeue them; by reaſon the externall great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and opinion of their perſecutors, wherto, by all ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and tyrannie, they haue aſpired, ſhall dazell the eies of men that they cannot diſcerne the truth.
<note n="*" place="margin">Where the Proteſtants Church was before Luthers daies.</note> Secondly, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that euen the members of the Church of Rome it ſelfe, as the Biſhops of France, and England with their congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for example, profeſſed thus <hi>outwardly</hi> to all the world the Chriſtian faith: for albeit they were, ſome of them more, and ſome leſſe, corrupted with the Apoſtacy vniuerſally ſpread ouer the Church: and had entertained the abuſes, that Luther, and the Reformers put away: yet the foundation remained, and the Scripture was preſerued: and the whole rule of faith: and in the agonies, and conflicts of their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they defended the truth of theſe things, and by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance caſt away their damnable errors: and all ſuch, euen in the middeſt of the Papacy, were <hi>outward profeſſors,</hi> and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our Church: yea God ſtirred vp among the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors themſelues, and ſuch as liued it communion with them, many that gaue witneſſe to the truth by teaching, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the ſeuerall articles thereof, ſome one, and ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, among their hereſies, and corruptions. And thus we ſay our religion alſo euery parcell of it, ſtood in the middeſt of the Papacy, and when the Church was moſt defaced. For

They had great witts to open, and extoll the doctrine of Ariſtotle, and Auerroes, and ſtudying in a manner nothing elſe, they deuiſed deepe and gulfelicke opinions that obſcured the Euangelicall light: yea by this practiſe of mingling Ariſtotle with their treatiſes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:20570:217"/> they had corrupted, and reiected all the articles of faith, beſide the vnity of the Deity.</hi> And touching their vehemency, and induſtry, in following their opinions, he ſayes, that which is worth the noting: <hi>The voice of their wings, that is to ſay, of their opinions, which they preſume to be high, and lofty; in wonderfull contentions, outcries, and raging, is like the voice of wheeles, or a tumultuous army running in war;</hi> this was a Friars report long agoe, and my owne knowledge of theſe things giues me aſſurance, and reſolution, whatſoeuer any man ſayes to the contrary; whoſe ignorance, and peruerſeneſſe, I will neuer ſuffer, to preiudice my certaine, and familiar knowledge.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 By <hi>that which</hi> he <hi>hath noted,</hi> he ſayes, <hi>it appeares that the Militant Church, or company of true Profeſſors, cannot at any time, be altogether inuiſible: ſpecially in ſuch ſort, or ſo long a time, as they ſay the Proteſtant Profeſſors were.</hi> The things he noted may be reduced to eight propoſitions in all. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the Church in the infancy, or beginning thereof was very ſmall, like a graine of Muſtardſeed: and toward the end alſo, in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:20570:217"/> time, ſhall be much decaied, both in the number of profeſſors, and in the viſibleneſſe of the outward ſtate. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> that this notwithſtanding, yet in all ages, betwixt the beginning, and the end, it is a great multitude ſpread ouer the world. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that the Church is not actually ſeene, at all times, by all men. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that yet it is viſible, that is, ſuch as may be ſeene, and knowne by all, if the impediments be not on their part, that ſhould ſee it: and by prudent, and diligent inquirie may be diſcerned at all times. And in the greateſt obſcurity, the world may ſee, and diſtinguiſh ſome eminent members therein. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> that it cannot alwaie practiſe the rites of diuine worſhip, publikely; but is forced ſometime to doe it in priuate. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> that yet it neuer wants ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Paſtours, nor the practiſe of rites appertaining to the Sacraments, and diuine worſhippe. <hi>Seuenthly,</hi> which practiſe, and inward ſtate of the Church ſhall neuer be ſo ſecret, but notice ſhall be had of it, euen by Infidels, and enemies: and the records thereof ſhall remaine in Hiſtories. <hi>Eightly,</hi> that it is the nature of the Church to be, in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, viſible, for diuers conſiderations. Theſe propoſitions containe the ſubſtance of that he noted; whereupon he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres 2. things. <hi>Firſt</hi> that the militant Church cannot, at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time, be <hi>altogether</hi> inuiſible. <hi>Next,</hi> that it cannot be inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>in ſuch ſort,</hi> or <hi>ſo long a time,</hi> as M. White ſaies, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Proteſtant religion were. The firſt I graunt him to be true, and he neede not ſo often haue inferred it, when it is not our aſſertion, that the Church at any time, is <hi>ſimply, abſolutely,</hi> or <hi>altogether,</hi> inuiſible, but onely <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> and reſpectiuely in compariſon of the reformed ſtate thereof. The ſecond is falſe, that <hi>it cannot be inuiſible in ſuch ſort, or ſo long as</hi> we <hi>ſay:</hi> for we ſay it was inuiſible in this <hi>ſort,</hi> that at ſome times, there was no congregation of people in the world <hi>viſibly</hi> profeſſing the faith, and viſibly adminiſtring the Sacraments, and Church diſcipline without much ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and corruption, or hereſie practiſed therewith; I ſay <hi>viſibly,</hi> in my aduerſaries ſenſe; that is, ſo as this congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was <hi>a great multitude ſpread ouer the world,</hi> whoſe faith, and
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:20570:218"/> adminiſtration, thus incorrupted, <hi>infidels,</hi> and <hi>enemies,</hi> had knowledge of, and <hi>Hiſtories</hi> recorded, and wherein ſome <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent</hi> men, might be diſcerned euen by the <hi>world:</hi> for the contrary is true, that all publike aſſemblies thus entirely without ſuperſtition, profeſſing, or holding the faith and Eccleſiaſticall gouernement, may be oppreſſed, and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. And thus I graunt the true Churches (whoſe ſound, and neceſſary faith we hold) failed throughout the world: nor do I here intend, or affirme, that there were no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>eminent</hi> perſons that held, or profeſſed the faith entirely for ſubſtance (all errors not being mortall) or no ſingular profeſſions of men that were of our religion, and refuſed the Papacy: for there were many ſuch in all ages, though <hi>Nullus,</hi> and <hi>Nemo</hi> be left out; but our aſſertion proceedes of ſuch congregations, as we call particular Churches: and this is enough to excuſe the qualitie, and condition of our Church in former times, and to refell the vaine bragges of our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, touching the externall ſucceſſion of the Church of Rome. For if this propoſition be true (which it muſt be, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Repliar, can refell it) <hi>The Church militant here on earth, may be ſo oppreſſed with perſecution, and infected with hereſie, that at ſometimes there can no particular congregation thereof be ſeene in all the world, either publikely, or priuately, profeſſing the true faith entirely without hereſie, and exercizing the preaching of the Gospell, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and diſcipline with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out corruption:</hi> hence it will follow that the Proteſtants graunting this of their Churches; diſaduantage not their religion: and our aduerſaries boaſting of their multitude and glorious ſucceſſion, may be the Miniſters of Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 But the Ieſuite ſaying that we <hi>conceit an inuiſible compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of profeſſing Proteſtants,</hi> is miſtaken. For I noted to him, that <q>we do not hold a definite number of perſons diſtinct from the members of the Church of Rome, and liuing apart in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſociety by themſelues, in ſecret, as it were
<note n="*" place="margin">Of whom Ioh. Pariſ. tract. de Antich. p. 46.</note> the 7. ſleepers lying hid in a mountaine: but we affirme this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany liued in the middeſt of the Church of Rome it ſelfe, and were the viſible profeſſours thereof. <hi>Firſt,</hi> ſome that kept
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:20570:218"/> themſelues from the damnable doctrines thereof, albeit they were corrupted with ſome leſſer errors whereof they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at their death. <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſome openly refuſed thoſe dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable doctrines, and ſuffered for the ſame. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the Papacy, as it grew on, and noted the abuſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and neuer ceaſed to complaine, and call for reformation. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> many that were ordinary Paſtors, and Biſhops in the Church of Rome, though poyſoned with damnable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, yet ſtill profeſſed the ſubſtance of faith, and repented them in diuers things, and maintained the Scripture to be the word of God. The which things do ſufficiently vphold the ſucceſſion of our doctrine: though Lombard, and Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, and Gerſon, and Occham, and ſuch as they were, be ſaid to be ſome of the perſons, in whom it ſucceeded: by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the reſt, which they held againſt vs, appeares by the Scriptures, and writings of the Apoſtolicke Church, to haue bene their owne inuentions.</q> This plainely ſhewes who were the <hi>Nullus,</hi> and <hi>Nemoes,</hi> that held the Proteſtants religion; when they did all this, ſome in a higher, and ſome in a lower degree, according to the meaſure of their knowledge, and meanes that they had, whom the Pope, and his Clergy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, and condemned for heretickes, though they were the beſt, and ſoundeſt part of the Church: in regard of which perſecution, reſtraining them that the truth might not be ſuffered openly in the congregations (which were all ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Antichriſt) we call them the <hi>inuiſible</hi> Church that was not ſeene to enioy religion, and diſcipline in the liberty, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and perſpicuitie, that we now do, and whom the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vnbeleeuers of the world could not diſcerne, or obſerue; by reaſon their eyes were blinded, that they ſhould not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the truth. I admoniſh the Replyar hereafter to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this, and not to reply vpon an opinion of his owne making, leaſt forging that which no man holds, and then, ſo Paedant like, ſquirting at it, his owne head proue a hiue for Platoes <hi>Ideas,</hi> and the caue where <hi>Chymaera</hi> neſtles himſelfe.</p>

               </argument>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:20570:223"/>
               <p>THere was in the kingdome of Peru a man, at that time, greatly eſteemed: a learned Diuine and a profeſſor of diuinitie, who, a long time together was accounted Catholick and godly, and almoſt the oracle of all this part of the world. This man was ſo linked in familiarity with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine woman who boaſted of herſelfe that ſhe was taught great myſteries by an Angell; and like another Philumena or Maximilla whom Montanus followed, was rapt out of her ſelfe, or at leaſt ſeemed ſo to be: that he often vſed to conſult with her about the greateſt queſtions in diuinity. In all things he eſteemed her as an Oracle, reporting her to be full of great reuelations and to be dearely beloued of God; who otherwiſe was but a baſe creature, and of ſmall ſenſe, vnleſſe it were to deuiſe lyes. Whether therefore ſhe were poſſeſſed by the Diuell, which is moſt likely: or whether ſhe counterfetted the matter when ſhe fell into her extaſie, as many wiſe men thought: this Diuine hearing great and ſtrange things, that in her exſtaſies ſhe would ſpeake of him, and conceauing that farre greater would afterward be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, addicted himſelfe thereupon to be her diſciple, whoſe ghoſtly father indeed himſelfe was. The man at length was ſo tranſported that he would aſſay to worke miracles, and perſwaded himſelfe that he did worke them, when no ſigne of any miracle appeared: for which cauſe, as alſo for recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing from this woman certaine propoſitions contrary to the ſenſe of the Catholike Church, he was apprehended by the iudges of the moſt holy Inquiſition: where by the ſpace of fiue yeares he was heard and examined, and at laſt detected to be the proudeſt and maddeſt man that liued. He would auouch that he had an Angell ſent from God, of whom he learned whatſoeuer he pleaſed: and that he had immediate conference and familiarity with God: and fell into thoſe toyes that no man in his right wits would vtter: yet all this while his vnderſtanding as concerning his brains was ſo ſound, that my owne is no ſounder. He would therefore ſay he ſhould be a King, and, in very good earneſt tell how he ſhould be Pope, and that the Apoſtolicke Sea ſhould be
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:20570:223"/> tranſlated into theſe kingdomes: that God had giuen him holineſſe aboue the Angels, and beyond all the Apoſtles: yea offered him the Hypoſtaticall vnion, but he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it. That he was giuen to be the redeemer of the world, in regard of the efficacie, whereas Chriſt was the redeemer but in regard of ſufficiencie. That all Eccleſiaſticall ſtates ſhould be abrogated; and he would giue new lawes that ſhould be plaine and eaſie, whereby the ſingle life of the Cleargie ſhould be taken away, and many wiues allowed; and the neceſſitie of ſhrift be abrogated. Theſe and many ſuch like things he affirmed, with ſuch confidence and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtnes, that we were amazed to ſee a man imagining theſe things, yet not to be out of his wits. At the laſt, when we had a long time conſidered his doings, and condemned aboue 120 propoſitions of his that were hereticall, and diſſonant from the doctrine of the Church; we were commanded to diſpute with him, to ſee if we could bring him backe to a right mind and the true faith. To which purpoſe the Iudges and the Biſhop of Quita, with others of vs, met together; where the man being brought in before vs, he maintained his cauſe with that libertie and eloquence of tongue, that I my ſelfe to this day am aſtoniſhed to think that euer a mans mind ſhould be filled with that pride. He profeſſed his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be ſuch, that it could not be demonſtrated but by the Scriptures and miracles; being farre beyond all humane reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; that, by the teſtimonies of the Scripture, he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his matter far more manifeſtly &amp; effectually, then S. Paul had proued Chriſt to be the true Meſſias: and that he had wrought ſuch and ſo many miracles, that the reſurrection of Chriſt was no greater miracle: for he ſaid, that he had bin dead, and was riſen again, and by euident teſtimonie had ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the ſame. And whereas he had no book, but had his very Breuiarie taken from him, yet he would rehearſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without book, ſuch and ſo long places, out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the Reuelation, the Pſalmes, and other parts, that his memorie was admirable: but then he ſo applied or allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed them to his conceit, that it would haue made any, either
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:20570:224"/> to haue laughed or wept. Finally, if we would handle the matter by miracles, he would preſently, he ſaid, ſhew them. Theſe things he ſpake ſo, as if he had taken vs for mad men, or had bin mad himſelfe. He told vs that it was reuealed vnto him, how Don Iohn of Auſtrich was ouercome in a fight at ſea, by the Turk: and that K. Philip had almoſt loſt his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Spaine:. and that they were in hand at Rome, with a Councell for the depoſing of the preſent Pope, and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a new. Which things, he ſaid he would tell vs; that we knowing them by certaine intelligence, might perceiue they came to him by diuine reuelation. The which things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt falſe, yet he auouched them as matters that we had certainly knowne. At the laſt, when in two daies conference with him, we could do no good, according to the maner of Spaine, we brought him with others to the publick ſpectacle of the people: where, looking vp to heauen, and expecting fire that from thence ſhould fall on the Inquiſitors, as the diuell had promiſed him; we felt no fire touch vs; but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was ſoone burnt and conſumed to aſhes.</p>

                  <hi>requiring them to make a like Catalogue of the Profeſſors of their faith in all ages ſince Chriſt;</hi> as he hath it downe a catalogue of his Church.
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:20570:224"/> His Catalogue is nothing elſe but a chronologicall Table, containing and repreſenting the names of all the POPES, and the moſt DOCTORS and ancient Fathers, and ſome GE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NERAL COVNCELS, and many PROFESSORS, as he cals them, <hi>of the Romane faith,</hi> which in euery age haue bin in the Church to this day; diſtinguiſhing the ages by centuries of yeares, and vnder euery centurie placing the <hi>Popes, Fathers, Councels</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> that liued &amp; were therein. In the firſt centurie he names our bleſſed Sauiour Chriſt, with his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Euangeliſts; and the Churches of Rome, Corinth, Galatia, with the reſt of the Apoſtolick Churches. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and ſo forward, be ſets downe the ancient Fathers of the Primitiue Church, with the Martyrs, Councels, holy men and nations conuerted, that were in euery age ſucceſsiuely till he come to the yeare 1600. The folly and error of this his Table, ſtands in fiue things: firſt, that he aſſumes theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Councels and nations, to himſelfe, as profeſsing his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh faith; who were indeed eminent members of the Church in their times, but neuer either profeſſed or ſaw that part of his Romane faith which we haue caſt off. For how ridiculous is it to ſay, that our Sauiour and his Apoſtles, and the reſt that follow for a thouſand yeares, beleeued and profeſſed as the Ieſuites now do, or as the Trent Councell hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in the Canons and new Creed thereof? The ſecond is, that the perſons named in the firſt ages, till 800 or a 1000 yeares after Chriſt, not onely profeſſed not the Papacie, but beleeued &amp; profeſſed that which directly deſtroyes it. They held that which the Church of Rome holds according to the Scriptures, and wherein the Papiſts and we conſent; but the things in time, and by peece-meale added to the truth, wherein we differ from them; they held not, but the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Let the Ieſuite therefore ſhew a catalogue of ſuch as in thoſe times profeſſed and beleeued, not onely what the Church of Rome beleeues aright, but what it holds againſt vs, in the ſeuerall articles of our difference. The third is that diuers Councels, eſpecially latterward, which reſiſted the Papacie comming on, are omitted; as thoſe of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:20570:225"/> Frankford, Piſa, Conſtance, Baſil, &amp;c. and many famous &amp; eminent Doctors omitted, that profeſſed directly againſt diuers articles of the now Church of Rome. The fourth is, that many falſe and fabulous Saints are named, and things. ſet downe out of Legends, that can never be proued: as the tale of the Iewes of Berytum conuerted by a bleeding Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixe, and ſuch like. The laſt is, that divers Popes, for many yeares together (namely in the ninth age) ſucceeded not, but entred violently and diſorderly: and very many, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the latter ages, are excepted againſt, vpon diuers points, purpoſely let downe in
<note n="*" place="margin">Digr. 53.</note> my former writing. His Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue therefore is to no purpoſe, as ſhall fully appeare in that which follower: for euen we our ſelues lay claime to ſo much of it as is true: and if he will giue vs leaue to adde the names of ſome others that liued after the 800 yeares; we will exhibite this very Catalogue our ſelues, and no other; ſaue that the Legend Saints, and the Friars and apoſtaticall Popes and Ieſuites, with ſuch traitors as Allen was, we need not. Next after the Catalogue, enſues the CHALLENGE TO PROTESTANTS, <hi>that they ſhew the like Catalogue.</hi> But this is idle. For we ſhew the ſame, if he will permit vs to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſome wants in the latter ages: profeſſing the Church of Rome it ſelfe, in all ages to haue bin the viſible Church of God; as I haue ſhewed in

               <p>After his challenge, containing onely one leafe, (the whole matter whereof is the ſame that I haue anſwered in the ſixe laſt chapters) he propounds certaine obiections, which he thought might be made againſt his Catalogue; thereby to give colour to the ſucceſſion of his Poperie.

Secondly I anſwer, that to ſay <hi>there be diuers points held by vs, whereof no mention is made in thoſe ancient Fathers,</hi> is no good argument to proue that which we hold, was not holden by them. For this is <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum ab authoritate negatiua:</hi> which argument is of no force to proue this point, vnles it be firſt proued that thoſe Fathers held nothing <hi>expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citè</hi> or <hi>implicitè,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is not expreſly to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in their writings. But this my aduerſaries will neuer be able to proue. Now on the contrary ſide, we can ſhew good reaſons, or at leaſt probable preſumptions, ſufficient to proue, firſt, that they held more then is expreſſed in their writings. Secondly that they held <hi>explicitè</hi> or <hi>implicitè</hi> the ſame in all points of doctrine, which we hold. Firſt I ſay, we haue reaſon to thinke that they held more then is expreſſed in their writings: becauſe (ſince ordinarily the writings of theſe Fathers were not by them ſet out of purpoſe, to expreſſe in particular euery thing that they held <hi>implicitè</hi> or <hi>explicitè</hi> concerning all matters of faith, but rather were written vpon ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:20570:227"/> occaſion) it is to be thought, that their writings contain only ſome parts of the doctrine, to wit, ſo much of it as was that requiſite to be written vpon that ſpecial occaſion. The which is confirmed euen by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of theſe our times, in which although learned men do ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſet downe more expreſly in Catechiſmes, bookes of controuerſies, &amp;c what the Catholik faith is in diuers points then formerly it hath bin ſet downe as they haue more occaſion, by reaſon of more hereſies daily ariſing, then learned men of former ages when thoſe hereſies were not, haue had. Yet no learned man now adaies writeth euery thing which <hi>explicitè</hi> or <hi>implicitè</hi> he beleeueth to be the Catholick faith. For euery Catholicke man beleeueth <hi>explicitè</hi> or <hi>implicitè</hi> all that is contained in Scriptures and traditions in that he beleeueth whatſoeuer was reuealed by God to the Apoſtles, &amp; deliuered by them in word or writing to the Catholicke Church: and which the Church in Scriptures and vnwritten traditions propoundeth and deliuereth to vs; diuers particulars whereof are not neceſſary to be expreſly knowne to, or written by any particular learned man of any age. but are alwaies preſerued at leaſt in the impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite or infolded faith of the Church: the which infolded faith of the Church, may and ſhall be vnfolded (the holy Ghoſt ſtill aſſiſting and ſuggeſting all the aforeſaid reuealed truth) as neceſſitie ſhall require, that the truth ſhould be in any point expreſly declared, which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie chiefly is when ſome new hereſie ariſeth, oppugning particularly the truth of that point.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p n="1">1 HEre he ſayes, the Fathers, named in his Catalogue, might hold what the church of Rome holds, though there be no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof in their writings, becauſe <hi>they might hold that which is not expreſly in their writings.</hi> We had thought, vntil now, that this had bin a plain demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The ancient Fathers in all their writings, make no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diuers points of the Popiſh religion: Ergo they held them not. Or thus: What religion the Fathers held, that they mention in their writings: But the Popiſh religion they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not in their writings: Ergo they held not the Popiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But he hauing good experience, that the ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is true, denies the firſt; and will ſhew, either <hi>by good reaſons,</hi> or <hi>probable preſumptions,</hi> that they held more then they mention and expreſſe in their bookes. Wherein at once he hath deſtroyed his Catalogue, and laid his religion open to the ſcorne of women and children. For if the Fathers in all their writings handled nothing but the cauſe of religion,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:20570:228"/> teaching, expounding and defending it, againſt Iewes, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, hereticks, ſchiſmatickes, whereby they could not but mention what they held; and yet neuer mentioned diuers points of Poperie; it is plaine they neuer held them. But the Ieſuite ſayes, this is <hi>Argumentum ab authoritate negatiua:</hi> which is not good; they might hold either <hi>explicitè</hi> or <hi>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citè</hi> that which they haue not expreſſed. Wherein you muſt marke his tergiuerſation. For to ſhew a viſible Church in all ages, profeſſing openly his Romane faith, that all men may ſee it, he tenders this catalogue. But when we bid him proue that the Fathers of the firſt 600 or 800 yeares beleeued and profeſſed that part of his Romane faith which the Church of England reiects, that it may appeare ſo to vs, and we may ſee it; he ſayes, he can ſhew <hi>good reaſons</hi> and <hi>preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that they beleeued more then is expreſſed in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: whereas he ſhould ſhew, by their WRITINGS, that they held and beleeued as the Romiſh Church now doth, becauſe it is impoſſible to ſhew what they held, but by their writings: and himſelfe ſayes in another place, <hi>We cannot haue any certaintie of things paſt, but by the writings of thoſe times.</hi> And if he will haue his Church to be ſo <hi>viſible</hi> in the Fathers time, and thoſe Fathers, to be ſo <hi>eminent</hi> members thereof; good reaſon men ſee it: yet ſee it they cannot by <hi>preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> but by their writings.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But he ſayes, <hi>We haue reaſon to thinke that they held more then expreſſed in their writings, forſomuch as no man writes euery thing which explicitè or implicitè he beleeues:</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, though it be granted, that both they and we in all our writings may omit ſome things not belonging to faith or religion, yet many articles of faith (ſuch as our aduerſaries ſay, theirs are, the deniall whereof they call ſchiſme and damnable hererſie, and perſecute with fire, ſword, and gun-powder) cannot but be expreſſed: for ſo much as ſuch arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are ſimply needfull vnto ſaluation, and are the grounds and concluſions of all theologicall writing and diſcourſe. Secondly, it is impertinent to the obiection; which denies the Fathers of the firſt 600 yeares to haue done that which

<pb n="416" facs="tcp:20570:229"/> Church holdeth.</hi> And as the Repliar himſelfe here expounds it, <hi>To beleeue whatſoeuer was reuealed by God in word or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Church; diuers particulars whereof are not neceſſary to be knowne or written expreſly at all times:</hi> but this vnfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded faith <hi>ſhall be vnfolded, as neceſſity ſhall require,</hi> that is, when <hi>ſome hereſie ariſes oppugning the truth of the point, which is thus implicitely beleeued.</hi> Hence it followes that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes theſe Fathers, Doctors, and Biſhops, mentioned in the firſt 600 yeares of this catalogue, knew not, profeſſed not, defended not, taught not, diuers points of the now Romane faith: becauſe in their times they were not points of faith, but made ſo ſince; and therfore by his owne confeſſion, they held them onely in this ſence, that they beleeued and taught whatſoeuer the Church ſhould, after their time, vnfold: by which deuice they may alſo be ſaid to haue beleeued, and viſibly profeſſed that the Moone is made of a greene cheeſe, or any thing that the Church of Rome ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after deuiſe whatſoeuer it be: for they implicitely beleeued all the faith of the Church, and this coyning of new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines ſhall be but <hi>vnfolding</hi> ſome part of the Churches faith that was infolded before: and ſo the Fathers ſhall be iuſtified to haue beleeued any thing, and the Romane Church to haue bin viſibly ſucceeding in them that neuer vnderſtood her doctrine. Is this then the meaning of the catalogue that ſo gloriouſly he diſplaies? and are all thoſe brags; <hi>ſhew vs a viſible Church in all ages as we do you; our faith is no other but what the ancient Doctors held: what they held, I hold; what they taught, I teach; what they beleeued, I beleeue:</hi> reſolued into this poore ſhift, They beleeued as we do, at leaſt <hi>implicitely?</hi> Is this the antiquitie of our Romiſh Church? and can her age be painted no better then thus? Were ſo many diuerſe points of her faith beleeued, by the ancient Church onely infoldly and vpon condition, If this Romane Church, after 600 or 1000 yeares, ſhould vnfold them? where then is the <hi>viſibilitie</hi> of theſe things in the Church of the Fathers? and the light thereof, that ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo clearly in their daies? Zeuxis the painter,

<pb n="417" facs="tcp:20570:229"/> choked him ſelfe with laughing at the picture of an old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that he had drawne in a table. His owne conceit, with beholding the wrinkles, and ſhadowes, and lookes, he had ſet vpon her face, ſo affected him, that he which had but a little before drawne the beautie and youth of Helena to the admiration of others, with a fooliſh counterfet of old age, killed himſelfe. And I am perſwaded that our aduerſaries, (this Replier and his fellows) when they behold the picture of this good old wife their mother the Papacie, how ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly they haue drawne it, making her to looke elder then ſhe is, by ſo many hundred yeares, and hanging it forth for the counterfet of antiquitie, cannot at the leaſt but ſmile at their owne deuice, to thinke how they mocke both others and themſelues, if they make not others burſt with laughter. But to quit this deuice of the Fathers holding <hi>implicitely</hi> that which is not expreſſed in their writings; let my replier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that they not onely make no mention of the things which we denie, but they write that which by all conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and diſcourſe ouerthrowes them. Though therfore we allow them a litle of the <hi>implicite</hi> faith, which God wot they neuer dreamed of, (it being a deuice of the latter School-men to ſerue another purpoſe) yet they could not <hi>implicitè</hi> beleeue any thing which would be oppoſite to that they mention and hold <hi>expreſly:</hi> as thoſe things are oppoſite which the Replier confeſſes to be <hi>the diuers things</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued <hi>implicitè,</hi> and their Church <hi>hath now vnfolded againſt new hereſies that are ariſen.</hi> Thus I reaſon: the Fathers held contrary to that which the Church of Rome now holds: <hi>ergo</hi> they beleeued it not implicitly. For implicite faith holds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to that which is explicite. Again, if they only held implicitely what the Church of Rome now holds, and not explicitely; hence it followes that the Romane faith in ſuch points cannot be <hi>viſibly</hi> ſhewed in the Fathers; for to be viſible, and to be onely <hi>implicitè,</hi> are contrary, in as much as no man can ſee or diſcerne that which is implicite: &amp; ſo the Romiſh faith may be ſhewed in a catalog of Turks as wel as in a catalog of the Fathers, by the Ieſuits diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

For ouer &amp; beſides the truth reuealed by the Apoſtles, the church of Rome ſucceſſiuely &amp; by degrees, in theſe laſt 800 years eſpecially, hath brought in diuers pernicious and damnable errors and corruptions tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Traditions, Tranſubſtantiation, Images, Iuſtification,

                     </hi> mentioned. Thus my anſwer is plain, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles deliuered to their ſucceſſors, to be preſerued againſt all innouation the whole Chriſtian doctrine: but the ſeuerall articles of the now Romiſh faith which we haue caſt off, are no part of that Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doctrine. Secondly my aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie replies, that it was the mind of the Apoſtles and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, not onely that the whole bodie of the truth ſhould be preſerued in ſome ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or other, but alſo that it ſhould be preſerued ſo <hi>inuiolate</hi> and <hi>entire,</hi> that <hi>no contrary error ſhould be taught with it:</hi> which being ſuppoſed, he ſayes <hi>it muſt be granted that it hath bin ſo preſerued in that ſucceſſion of Paſtors which his Catalogue ſheweth;</hi> becauſe the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are able to ſhew no other Paſtors. His whole diſcourſe affirmes two things: the firſt, that the bodie of Chriſtian doctrine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Paſtors of the church, doth not at any time faile either in whole or part, but is preſerued inuiolate and entire from all errors growing thereto. The ſecond, that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants can ſhew no other ſucceſſion of Paſtors, whereto this doctrine was committed then is contained in his catalogue. Hence he concludes, that his now church of Rome holds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what the ancient Fathers held. I anſwer to the ſecond, touching the Catalogue, that for the firſt 600 yeares, we approue it, confeſsing the Paſtors and Chriſtians men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned therein, to haue bin the true Church. And for the reſt of the ages to this day, we will allow the Catalogue with three limitations: firſt, that the Paſtors and people therein named, be confeſſed to haue kept the faith leſſe pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then they of the former ages; ſo that the lower they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, the more they were corrupted. Secondly, that from

Let the Catalogue be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and vndertaken in this manner, and the Paſtors and the people contained therein ſhall be yeelded to be the ſame that Chriſt and his Apoſtles committed the truth to: and in the meane time the Repliar doth but trouble himſelfe, and ſeduce his Reader, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he beares him in hand that we deſire to ſhew other Paſtors or people beſides theſe; all Proteſtants freely affirming their faith to haue ſucceeded euen in the Church of Rome it ſelfe: though the errors thereof were no part of their faith but the inuentions of men added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 But the firſt thing affirmed, that the Chriſtian doctrine committed to the Paſtours of the Church cannot faile in any degree or part thereof, but is alway preſerued <hi>inuiolate</hi> and <hi>entire from all error,</hi> is falſe.

<note place="margin">How the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre.</note> yet (as I haue ſhewed) the euent teaches that ſometime it falls out otherwiſe: in the ſame manner that it is Gods ordinance that no man ſhould ſinne, and yet all men do ſinne.

Beſide, if <hi>Gods ordinance,</hi> or the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> intendiment, did warrant the Paſtors of the Church, that they ſhould not erre at leaſt vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally, how comes it to paſſe that euen euery Doctor in his Catalogue from Dyoniſius and Ignatius to Stapleton and Bellarmine haue had their errors, all his Councels haue had theirs, and the moſt of his Popes haue decreed one againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and there is not one Diuine in all his Catalogue (not his deareſt Thomas of Aquin) but he will confeſſe him to haue erred? yet erre he ſhould not, if the prouidence of God were to preſerue the Doctors of his Church from all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in the degree that the Replie ſayes. The truth therefore ſucceeds continually in the Church without ceaſing, but firſt: <q>Not alway in all, nor in the higheſt Paſtors. Secondly: Nor alway without corruption.

This alſo to be ſo, is ſhewed in the Proteſtants Apologie, where particularly is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, out of diuerſe learned Proteſtant writers: firſt, that the faith we profeſſe is the ſame that Saint Gregory profeſſed; and, by Saint Auſtine the Monke, taught vs Engliſh men, at our firſt conuerſion. Secondly, that the ſame faith was vniuerſally profeſſed for ſundry ages before, and namely that it agreed in ſubſtance with the firſt faith to which the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans were conuerted in the Apoſtles dayes. Thirdly, that diuerſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular points of our doctrine are acknowledged by learned Proteſtants to haue bene taught by the ancient Fathers, namely Vowes, Reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, &amp;c. For all which the ſaid Proteſtant Apology citeth the names, and bookes, and oftentimes the very words of the learned Proteſtants, as may be ſeene, and I wiſh the Reader for his more ſatisfaction to ſee. Laſtly, that our Church holdeth the very ſame and no other faith in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, then that which was held by the ancient Church, may appeare by the very nature, as I may ſay, of our Church; whoſe property and condition is not to inuent of new, or to alter any doctrine, in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith; but to receiue humbly and obediently, at the hands of our preſent Paſtours, what they in like manner learned of their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; and ſtill to hate, and reſiſt all innouation in any matter of faith no leſſe then a deadly poiſon, as knowing that the leaſt infection of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new inuented hereſie or alteration in matter of faith doth corrupt and adulterate the whole faith, and taketh away infallible authoritie and credite from the Church. Wherefore our Paſtors haue bene, like men appointed to watch, very vigilant in noting, reprehending, reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and condemning all innouation in faith and ſometimes caſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible members out of the Church, euen for a word or two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely innouated contrary to the cuſtome and faith of the Church. The which courſe being duly obſerued (as chiefely by Gods prouidence and partly by humane diligence it hath bene and ſhall be ſtill obſerued) it is not poſſible that there ſhould be ſuch alteration in religion, or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

Firſt if the Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgenſes acknowledge <hi>the Fathers in many points</hi> to be for the Papiſts: which they no where do: yet that is not <hi>all the Fathers, with vnanime conſent, point by point,</hi> in all points. Some particular Fathers, the Repliar knowes well enough, ſpeake that which hath no <hi>vnanime conſent</hi> of the reſt: and their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate opinions may giue colour <hi>to many things,</hi> and yet will not reach <hi>from point to point.</hi> Next, it is falſe that is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the Centuries. They teſtifie no more but what they thought that Fathers held corruptly, and themſelues iudged to be <hi>errors</hi> and <hi>blemiſhes</hi> in their writings. There is no Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh writer at this day but he doth the ſame. Baronius in his Annals, purpoſely intended againſt the Centuries, hath not left one Father, or one ancient hiſtory, vncenſured: but ſtill charges it with ſome <hi>error</hi> and <hi>blemiſh</hi> or other. But my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary ſayes, <hi>the things which the Centuries ſay were blemiſhes in the Fathers, are ſuch points as the Church of Rome now holds: whereby</hi> it ſhould ſeeme that <hi>in many things, they teſtifie with the Church of Rome againſt the Proteſtants.</hi> I anſwer, firſt that in ſome points (as the diligenteſt that are may ſometime o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſee) and now and then, they miſtake, and call that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, or the error, of a Father, that is not. This kind of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſight we perceiue and pardon in our Aduerſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Secondly diuers things noted by them for errors in the Fathers, are not holden by the Church of Rome, but are
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:20570:236"/> cenſured alſo by our Aduerſaries themſelues, as well as by the Centuries. Thirdly, diuers points, in particular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, are taxed, which belong to that which is now holden in the Church of Rome; but this iuſtifies not the Papiſts: firſt becauſe in ſuch points there is no <hi>vnanime</hi> conſent of all the Fathers, or all the Church, but onely the vnſetled, and ambulatory opinions of ſome priuate Doctors. Next, what theſe Doctors deliuered touching ſuch points, is holden o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and to other intents and purpoſes, now in the Church of Rome; as their praying for the dead, which the Centuries iuſtly note for a blemiſh, was not with opinion of Purgatory, as now it is in Rome. Thirdly, the myſtery of iniquity began to worke in the primitiue Church: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the fathers themſelues (though Biſhops of the Church and moſt holy men, yet but men) ſometime were deceiued, and brought into error in ſome things; thus it is written of Papias,
<note n="r" place="margin">Baron. an. 118 n. 2. &amp; 6.</note> a Biſhop of great authority in the Church, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the holines of his life, that, by miſunderſtanding

<pb n="433" facs="tcp:20570:237"/> what he held, is now otherwiſe expounded and applied then by him it was. For example, in the matter of images he was ſuperſtitious

<pb n="434" facs="tcp:20570:238"/> this life, to them he more mercifully giues that; to them, in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bleſſedneſſe, an hundredfold fruite ſhall be rewarded.</hi> This profeſſion of Gregory is farre from that which
<note n="a" place="margin">Before §. where M. Baius his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is laied downe.</note> I haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Church of Rome now profeſſes touching the merite of our works. Secondly, whereas, our of Briarly, he ſaies, the <hi>Faith profeſſed by Gregory, and taught the Engliſh men by Auſtine, at our firſt conuerſion, agreed, for ſubſtance, with the firſt faith whereto the Brittans were conuerted in the Apoſtles daies, and was the ſame which vniuerſally was profeſſed:</hi> We muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh: for Gregory, and Auſtine no doubt taught ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny points that were true, and wherein we conſent with them, yea the ſubſtance of ſauing faith: but ſome things they innouated, (wherein the Church of Rome now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes them) adding to the wordes of wholeſome doctrine their owne corrupt opinions: the firſt, we graunt was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed before, and <hi>was the faith of the Brittans at their firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion:</hi> but not the latter. And herein appeares the cunning and fraude of our aduerſaries, that by the teſtimonies of ſuch as affirme Gregoryes faith, in things of the firſt kind, to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolik, go about to proue it to be ſuch alſo in things of the latter kinde. The Repliar therefore hath to proue, that (not the truthes which they taught, but) the additions which they brought in (wherein the Proteſtants refuſe them) were <hi>the ſubſtance</hi> of their faith, and that whereto our nation was conuerted in the Apoſtles time. Which they can neuer do. Thirdly, <hi>that diuers particular points,</hi> of the Papiſts doctrine, <hi>are acknowledged, by learned Proteſtants, to haue bene taught by the ancient Fathers: as Vowes, Reall preſence,</hi> &amp;c. is anſwered before, in the ſecond obiection, touching the Centuries. And by the D. of Wincheſter in his booke againſt Briarly,
<note n="b" place="margin">Prot. App. l. 2. c. 1. &amp; inde.</note> where the particular inſtances are examined. And if the Repliar and his Author will make good their aſſertion, they muſt proue that the Fathers, with <hi>one conſent</hi> taught theſe things: and withall ſo meant and expounded them as they are now meant and expounded in the Papacy. Let this be done, in thoſe points that we refuſe, and good reaſon the game be theirs. But if theſe <hi>learned Proteſtants</hi> do no more but note
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:20570:238"/> the <hi>particular</hi> corruptions that crept into <hi>particular</hi> writings and Churches, whereby our aduerſaries haue taken occaſion to increaſe them; they muſt not be ſaid to acknowledge ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that theſe things were the Catholicke doctrine of the whole Church, or that they were intended and beleeued as the Romane Church now beleeues them,</p>
               <p n="4">4 His fourth and laſt argument is, <hi>becauſe</hi> (forſooth) <hi>it is not the condition of</hi> the Romane Church, <hi>to inuent, or alter, any doctrine; but humbly and obediently to maintaine what they haue receaued from their predeceſſors; to hate innouation; to note, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, reſiſt all innouation in faith: that it cannot be poſſible there ſhould be any difference betweene the faith of the Fathers, and the doctrine of the Church of Rome: as the Proteſtants ignorantly and maliciouſly obiect.</hi> And indeed if that part of the Church of Rome which we haue refuſed (I meane the Papacy) were the true vniuerſall Church, he ſaid well; for it is againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of that Church to diſſent from any part of the ancient faith: as he hath well obſerued out of his <hi>Gregory,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius:</hi> but how will he proue that ſide, and faction in the Church of Rome, which is charged with innouating and diſſenting, to be the true Church? how ſhall the reader be aſſured that theſe heards of Popes, Cardinals, Prelats, Monkes, Friars, Ieſuites, are thoſe faithfull Paſtors whoſe nature is not to innouate, when all the world hath diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them and their doctrine to be nothing elſe but weedes and excrements ariſing in the Church? Is there not an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<note n="a" place="margin">Greg. Val. p. 96. tom. 3.</note> in the Spaniard quoted, that ſaies, <hi>By the vnfolded act of faith, the ſame things haue not alway bene beleeued: but diuers points, in the progreſſe of time, haue bene manifeſt and beleeued?</hi> Doth not Auſtine of Ancona

<pb n="436" facs="tcp:20570:239"/> part of the old Churches infolded faith; and theſe men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the formalleſt innouators that euer were, yet muſt be ſaid to diſſent from the Fathers in nothing, becauſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they daily inuent and innouate, the Fathers held at leaſt implicitely.

But this was for the confutation of hereſies riſing; and for the more expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the formerly receaued faith: and they haue vſed more ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant words then formerly were vſed; but yet the ſenſe of ſuch words differs not from the faith and phraſes formerly vſed, but onely explicate more plainely that which was formerly beleeued by the Church: which kinde of explication Vincentius allowes in his golden Treatiſe.</hi> But all this is vntrue, and is briefely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: the Church of Rome, and the D D. therein, ſince the Fathers time, haue done more then either <hi>the explicating</hi> of the ancient faith, or <hi>giuing new names to old articles.</hi> They haue innouated, diminiſhed, corrupted the ſubſtance of the articles themſelues; as I ſhewed particularly

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:20570:240"/> found diuers errors, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the former faith of the Fathers. To iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the truth of this obiection, it ſeemeth that M. White hath with great paines raked together all the riffe-raffe and odde opinions he could finde in any particular Catholicke Authors, as thinking be like this way to diſcredit the Catholicke cauſe. But he is very ſhallow witted if hee thinke by this meanes to ouerthrow or ſhake the vniuerſall faith of the Catholicke Church.
<note place="margin">Introduct. queſt. 3.</note> For (as I noted in the Introduction) the Catholicke Church doth not binde her faith vpon any priuate Doctors opinion: nor indeed do thoſe priuate Doctors deliuer their ſaid opinions, as any points of their owne, or other mens faith, euen then when, in theſe their priuate opinions, they hold this or that matter to pertaine to faith, which other men thinke not to pertaine to faith, but rather ſubmit all their opinions (as hereticall Doctors, which haue no faith but priuate opinions, wil not) to the faith, iudgement and cenſure of the Catholicke Church, being alſo ready to renounce any of their opinions, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer by lawfull definitiue ſentence of the preſent Paſtours, or otherwiſe they may perceiue them to be contrary to the ancient faith of the Church. Hence M. White may ſee, how vainely he hath ſpent his time in ſeeking the ſinkes, and ſweeping together ſo many odde ſentences of ſome Catholicke Authors, as here and there he noteth in his writings, the which haue no more force againſt the ſincere vnity of doctrine of faith maintained by the authority of our Church, then that heape of filth and ordure of ill life of ſome particular men, which he hath ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped together, doth proue againſt the ſanctitie of the profeſſion of the Catholicke Church. And it is maruaile that the man hath ſo little wit, as to labour ſo much either in ſhewing the contrariety of opinions among Catholickes, which altogether is impertinent to the vnity of their faith: or in diſcouering the faults of ſome leude perſons, which is altogether impertinent to the ſanctity of the profeſſion of the Church, eſpecially when if he did but looke into the boſome of his owne Proteſtant congregation, and particularly into the life and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the very primitiue parents thereof, he may finde it no leſſe, but (all circumſtances conſidered, namely of the ſmalneſſe of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, and the little ſpace of time ſince it came into the world, &amp;c.) far more faulty in either kinde. And ſo he ought to haue bene affraid leaſt when he had ſaid all againſt Catholickes, that his blind zeale or malice could deuiſe; that the ſhame would be returned ſo much the more againſt his Euangelicall brethren, ſome of which (as Luther confeſſeth) haue bene for their ill liues far worſe then euen themſelues were when they were Papiſts: and (as I may boldly ſay) for odde er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, abſurd and impious opinions, far worſe then any Papiſts. Which their abſurd and impious opinions who liſt to reade, he may finde ſet downe in Caluino-Turciſmo and other Authors:
<note place="margin">See Caluino-Turciſmus.</note> and may oppoſe them to theſe which M. White relateth, with this aduantage, that whereas if by ignorance or paſſion, ſome Catholicke writers hold any vnfit opinions;
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:20570:240"/> yet actually or virtually they ſubmit them to the faith and cenſure of the Church: and ſo are not to be thought obſtinately to erre in faith but in priuate opinion, about ſome matter not ſufficiently knowne to them to be contrary to the faith of the Catholicke Church. But Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Doctors (who haue no other faith but their owne firmely ſetled opinion, gathered, as it ſeemeth to them, out of Scripture, who alſo will not, neither actually nor virtually ſubmit theſe their opinions to the faith and cenſure of any Church, ours, or their owne) may (by their erronious opinions obſtinately mainteined againſt the Church) be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced of ſo many abſurd and impious obſtinate errors in faith, as they haue abſurd and impious opinions grounded, as it ſeemeth to them, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Scriptures.
<note place="margin">White p. 349.</note> But it ſeemeth M. White regardeth not what may be obiected againſt his brethren, ſo that he may ſay ſomething againſt vs: and therefore in one place he doth (in effect) vrge this argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs: If the ancient Catholicke truth did continue among vs in all points, then there could not be among our Doctors variety of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in any point, <hi>no more then there is in the doctrine of the bleſſed Trinity or Incarnation.</hi> I anſwer, firſt, that this may better be vrged againſt the Proteſtants, who, as appeareth in Caluino-Turciſmo, haue not onely vncertainty and variety of opinions in other points, but euen about the doctrine of the bleſſed Trinity, and Incarnation; neither haue they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch ſufficient meanes (as we haue) to take away this variety of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Secondly, I anſwer that the variety of opinions which is among our Doctors, either is not in matters pertaining to faith: or, if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pertaine to faith, the varietie is not in the ſubſtance of the point, but in ſome circumſtance which may be held this or other waies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preiudice to faith: or if in ſome rare caſe any priuate Doctors hold opinion againſt the ſubſtance, or circumſtance, ſo far as pertaineth to faith, this is in ignorance, and with readines to put away this opinion ſo ſoone as they vnderſtand the contrary to pertaine to faith by ſome euident proofe of Scripture, or tradition, or by declaration of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church: which is an argument, that although they erre in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet they erre not in implicite beleefe euen of the very point, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in through ignorance they do erre in opinion. Now the reaſon why this ignorance, and conſequently variety of opinion may bee in ſome points, which formerly were held as points of faith, rather then in the doctrine of the bleſſed Trinity and Incarnation, is, becauſe theſe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are more neceſſary to be expreſly knowne of all ſorts, then ſome other points of faith are, and conſequently men are (as they are bound) more carefull to get expreſſe knowledge of them, according to the knowne ſence &amp; expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church, which Church alſo hath more expreſly determined what is to be holden in theſe points then in ſome others, which (although neceſſary to be beleeued <hi>explicitè</hi> or <hi>implicitè</hi>) are not ſo neceſſary to be expreſly knowne of all ſorts.</q>

And that which the Repliar anſwers, ſatisfies not the obiection. For it is true, <hi>The Catholicke Church builds not her faith vpon priuate Doctors opinions:</hi> but the Romane Church, which the Repliar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for, and whoſe ſucceſſion he demonſtrates in his cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, conſiſts in no other but ſuch <hi>Doctors,</hi> that held ſuch <hi>priuate opinions,</hi> and ſuch people as followed them therein: or elſe let him name, if he can, any one of his Doctors that held not ſuch priuate opinions; or any other Church of his, that conſiſted not in theſe? A man may eaſily ſee he can neuer winde himſelfe out of this ſtraight. And let it be granted alſo that <hi>they were ready to renounce theſe opinions,</hi> thus holden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the former faith, <hi>and to ſubmit themſelues to the Church:</hi> yet the former difficulty returns againe; for whether they were thus <hi>ready,</hi> or no, yet they ſwarued from the faith of the Fathers: no matter with what minde, when the Repliar, ſo confidently bills them in his catalogue for ſuch as <hi>preſerued the whole corps of the reuealed truth without innouation.</hi> Thereby vndertaking to name ſuch as, in all things, trod in the ſteps of the Fathers, without any error that ſhould need <hi>ſubmiſſion.</hi>
                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:20570:241"/> Againe where, and in whom was this Church whereto they were ſo ready to ſubmit themſelues? who ſhould reforme them when themſelues were the Church? for example when Gregory the 7. that was Pope in the 10 age: Eugenius the 3. and Boniface the 8. in the 12. Vrbanus 6. and Iohn 22. in the 13. Gregory 12. Iohn 23. Eugenius 4. in the 14. age; by ſchiſme, error, and hereſie, innouated the faith, where was their ſubmiſſion to the Church? how could it be, when them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues were heads of the Church? and how was it done, when contrariwiſe they made oppoſition againſt all ſuch as admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them? But the third thing he anſwers, that <hi>thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate D D. deliuer not their ſaid opinions as points of faith,</hi> is falſe; becauſe they are in ſuch points as are now controuerted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs and the Church of Rome; which the Repliar, I preſume, will allow to be no other but points of faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2 This I had to ſay touching the obiection, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliar hath ſet it downe, fraudulently and maimedly: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if he had propoſed it effectually as we obiected, all his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer were impertinent. For we ſay, that not onely <hi>in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mens</hi> writings are found many things contrary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer faith of the Fathers: but in the doctrine of <hi>the Church it ſelfe,</hi> as it is practiſed and expounded by ſuch as are depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto. The which I demonſtrated throughout my Booke, in euery controuerſie, by alleadging the wordes of the chiefeſt and moſt emine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t writers in the Church of Rome, expounding the doctrine holden in the ſaid Church. There being, indeed, very little of their religion, but ſome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther among them ſo expound it, and ſo teach the Church-meaning therein, that it is eaſie to ſee the ancient faith to be innouated thereby. And I care not though my aduerſary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his anſwer with a little confidence: <hi>It ſeemes M. White hath, with great paines, raked together all the riffe raffe and odde opinions: and spent his time in ſeeking the ſinkes, and ſweeping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether odde ſentences of ſome Catholicke authors, &amp;c.</hi> For his leane and lancke cauſe had neede of bombaſt; but whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall enquire what M. White alleadged, ſhall well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the Popiſh D D. whom he hath <hi>raked</hi> together, to be
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:20570:242"/> the eminenteſt men that were in the Church of Rome, and their doctrine and opinions cited, ſo farre as I haue refuſed it, to be <hi>riffe raffe</hi> indeed and ſuch as lies in <hi>ſinkes and ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi> but yet ſuch <hi>riffe raffe,</hi> as the Romiſh Church it ſelfe (now turned into a <hi>ſinke</hi> of all filthy hereſie, &amp; peſtered with the <hi>ſweepings</hi> of all the falſe doctrine and errors of old here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes) maintaines, and offers to the world, for ſound reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as I haue ſhewed in the beginning of this booke: where the ſpeech of Mic. Bayus (the onely inſtance that the Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar thought good to make of my charging his Church with priuate Doctors opinions) which he will not deny to be part of the <hi>riffe raffe,</hi> and <hi>ſweepings</hi> here mentioned, is proued to containe no other matter then is generally holden by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and to be the doctrine of the Church of Rome as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely as any other that himſelfe can aſſigne to be the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p n="3">3 This therefore is it I ſay, that the errors obiected to the Doctors and Schoolemen, of the Church of Rome, and the manifold abſurdities which I haue obſerued in them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging their wordes in my Booke: are a ſufficient argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to proue the Church of Rome, wherein they liued, and whoſe Paſtors they were, to hold contrary to the Fathers, and to be departed from the Apoſtolicke faith. And all this furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of wordes to the contrary, is but a deſperate ſhift to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide the inconuenience that followes vpon it. For firſt: <hi>the vniuerſall faith of the Catholicke Church is not diſcredited by the priuate opinions of particular Authors.</hi> This I graunt, and will yeeld my ſelfe to be both <hi>vaine</hi> and <hi>ſhallow witted,</hi> if the things I haue alleadged out of Popiſh Authors be not the faith of the Romiſh Church: (at leaſt, for any thing that can be ſhewed) as much as that which my aduerſary will defend to be the faith. And for confirmation hereof there is very little either defined by the Pope and his Councels, or ſo defined that there remaines no ambiguity in the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but ſome ſay this is the faith, and ſome that, expounding all things after their owne iudgement: ſo that he which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadges the opinion, or aſſertion, of a Popiſh authorized
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:20570:242"/> Doctor, (and I alledge no other) alledges the Church opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for any thing that can be ſhewed to the contrary. Which if the Repliar will deny, let him giue me a certaine rule, whereby I may, without error, diſcerne which is the Church doctrine, and which a priuate opinion. For if he ſay, that onely is the Church doctrine that is defined by the Pope: I will produce his Doctors that expound the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that ſenſe that I ſay, cleane againſt the doctrine of the ancient Fathers. If he deny, or refuſe the party, whom I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge, or bring other writers that expound otherwiſe; let him deale ſincerely, and demonſtrate why he, and his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, ſhould be thought to report the true definition, rather then I and my author, being in all points equall to the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Church of Rome? As when I alledge Thomas, for

Secondly that the Church hath not ſo expreſly determined them. Thirdly, men are not bound to be ſo carefull in getting the expreſſe knowledge of them. This is the ſame that I ſaid: <hi>They were not therefore ſo vniuerſally receiued in the Church.</hi> And confirmes my aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this place, that they are not to be viſibly ſeene and read in the writings of the Doctors of the primitiue Church.
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:20570:244"/> For being neither neceſſary to be knowne, nor expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, nor ſuch as men thought themſelues bound to learne; how ſhould they write them? And if they writ them not, it will be but labor loſt for the Repliar to go about to proue they beleeued them; his implicite beleeuing is too ſhort: and then if they beleeued them not, downe comes the catalogue, and the Church of Rome (which I beleeue expreſly) will proue the ſeate of Antichriſt, and mother of hereſies, thus to maintaine that which the ancient Church neither writ, nor read, nor yet beleeued.</p>

<note place="margin">Pag. 278. Wh. in his Praef to the reader.</note> for defining that the ſame adoration and ſeruice ought to be giuen to images of Saints, which is giuen to the diuine Trinity. But firſt, the Nicene Councell, which indeed was a generall Councell, did not define that images were to be worſhipped with honour onely due to God; which ſuppoſeth that men muſt accompt images Gods. This groſſe conceite, could neuer haue entred into any Chriſtian mans minde, who knoweth the firſt rudiments of Chriſtian Religion, that there is but one onely God: and therefore it may not be thought that ſo many reuerend and learned Biſhops, as were at that Councell (whom this Miniſter malepertly calleth <hi>vnlearned,</hi> and <hi>ſimple perſons</hi>) could euer haue conceiued, and much leſſe that they would haue definitiuely concluded ſo groſſe an errour and publiſhed it to the world. Nay the Nicene Councell was ſo farre from defining, that images were to be worſhipped with latria, or diuine honour, as expreſſely it denieth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine honour to be done to them: as appeareth by theſe wordes of that Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel. <hi>We define images to be honored, &amp;c. that by looking vpon the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted images, all that do behold them may come to the remembrance, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the things repreſented by them, and may exhibite to them an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſalutation, and worſhip, not, according to our faith, true latria, which is due onely to the diuine honour.</hi> Now as touching the Franke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Councell: firſt, it was not Generall, neither euer did the Popes Legates (if they were preſent) aſſent to condemne the Nicene Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> neither did the Pope euer confirme any ſuch condemnation. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Beſides, no ſuch condemnation is to be found in the Councell of Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> all that is found being in a forged booke, aſcribed falſely to Charles the Great: in which alſo that feigned canon, which is cited as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the canon of the Councell of Frankeford, nameth not the Nicene, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the Conſtantinopolitan Councell.

               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, he vpbraids me with <hi>malepertneſſe,</hi> for calling the Biſhops of the Nicene Councell <hi>ſimple and vnlearned;</hi> but it is his deſtiny ſtill to croſſe and infatuate himſelfe with his forwardneſſe; for his owne words calls them <hi>groſſe conceited,</hi> and <hi>ignorant of the firſt rudiments of religion,</hi> that hold, the ſeruing and adoring of images, with the ſame adoration and ſeruice that is giuen to the Trinitie.

<pb n="455" facs="tcp:20570:249"/> worſe. Thus therefore I excuſe my ſelfe: it is no male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertneſſe to call them ſimple or vnlearned, who teach the giuing of diuine honour to an image, becauſe the Replier confeſſeth this to be <hi>a groſſe conceite of ſuch as know not the firſt rudiments of religion, nor that there is a God.</hi> But the ſecond Nicene Councell taught this. For Azorius ſayes, <hi>it inſinuated the worſhipping of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, with the ſame worſhippe that is giuen to the ſamplars,</hi> which is diuine worſhippe in the images of God and Chriſt. They inſinuated therefore, that images ſhould be worſhipped with diuine honour, the ſame that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to God and Chriſt: Therefore they were a packe of ſimple and vnlearned heretickes. But becauſe he is ſo zealous for his friends, I will, if I can, a little coole him, till hee know better what and who they were. Claudius Eſpencaeus, a Doctour in his owne Church,

Whereto hee anſwers not one true word. Firſt hee ſayes, the Councell of Frankford was not generall. But I had witneſſes in the margent, that it was.

For which cauſe alſo he aſſembled a Councell, and by his authoritie decreed, and that vnder an oath, that they ſhould be ſet vp and worſhipped, when it is lawfull indeed to erect them, but vtterly vnlawfull to worſhip them.</hi> The ſame Councell of Paris

               <p n="5">5 But the Replier ſayes, <hi>All that is found</hi> touching this <hi>condemnation, is but in a forged booke aſcribed falſely to Charles.</hi> This is vntrue twiſe ouer; Firſt, becauſe, as I haue now ſhewed, many others ſay it as well as the Booke of Charles.

In which booke (alas for griefe) many things are found inconuenient and contrarie to the faith. But especially that it was decreed by the conſent of almoſt all the Eaſterne Doctors, no leſſe then three hundred, or aboue,</hi> (this was the ſecond Nicene Councell) <hi>that images ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored, which the Church of God altogether abhorreth; againſt
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:20570:251"/> which thing, Albinus wrote an Epiſtle, maruellouſly confirmed with the authoritie of the Scripture, and in the name of the Biſhops and Nobles, brought the ſame with the booke to the King of France.</hi> Albinus therefore, it ſeemes penned it, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and State approoued it, and the Emperour ratified and publiſhed it. This makes it of more authoritie then if the Emperour alone had done it. But who penned it, it is impertinent, when Bellarmine and Baronius graunt, <hi>it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines the acts of the Councell of Francford, and no man may doubt but the Councell therein condemned is the ſecond Nicene.</hi> For this is enough to prooue the Nicene Councell to be condemned by the Councell of Frankford, whoſoeuer were the author of Charles his booke. That which the Replier obiects touching the <hi>Conſtantinopolitane Councell named</hi> in ſtead of the Nicene, helpes him not. Bellarmine
<note n="y" place="margin">De imag. l. 21 c. 14. §. Neque obſtat.</note> anſwers, <hi>Conſtantinople is ſet downe in ſtead of Nice through vnskilfulneſſe or want of memorie.</hi> And
<note n="z" place="margin">An. 794. n. 33.</note> Baronius: though he hold the councell of Conſtantinople, that decreed images ſhould be broken, is meant there; yet he grants the councell of Nice is meant and condemned alſo. And it muſt needs be as Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine ſayes: for though Conſtantinople be named, yet it is added, that <hi>there it was decreed that images ſhould be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped;</hi> which was not done in the Conſtantinopolitane, but in the Nicene councell. All which being put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the teſtimonies I meane whereby the booke is proued to be Charles his, and the Councell meant, to be the ſecond Nicene, it appeares plainly that the booke is authenticall, and the author thereof both knew well enough <hi>what the Conſtantinopolitane and Frankford decreed;</hi> and <hi>ſet downe</hi> the Canon, neither by heare-ſay, nor at aduenture, nor yet <hi>by the imagination of his owne head,</hi> but with good aduice, and vpon certaine knowledge. It being the vaineſt point of a thouſand, to imagine that Albine and the whole Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of England, France, Germanie, and Italie, with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie and States, ſhould condemne a thing which they vnderſtood not: and now, after eight hundred yeares, the
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:20570:252"/> true knowledge of all things ſhould come (by ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation belike) to a few arrogant Ieſuites, who yet can agree in nothing about the ſame. I admoniſh the Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, by this example, wherein he hath ſped ſo vnluckily, not to thinke to deface the truth with boldneſſe and bragging, but to giue way to the truth; and in ſeeking it, to tie himſelfe to no mans deuice, till he haue better aſſurance of it. For there is ſcarce one example of antiquitie that we produce againſt them, but his Ieſuites are deuided in their anſwers, and ſpeake ſo contrary one to another, that it is eaſie to ſee, they intend nothing but to be obſtinate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute. And ſo the example of the ſecond Nicene coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell ſhewes, that the Popes councels, how generall or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued ſoeuer, haue erred in defining, by the iudgement of the whole Chriſtian world: and their errors had beene controlled in former ages, as well as the Proteſtants now controll them: ſo that the things wherein we refuſe the church of Rome, are nothing elſe but the corruptions and abuſes that came in by the faction of ſome, and were oppoſed by the ſounder part of the Church as they grew and came in.</p>

                  <pb n="465" facs="tcp:20570:254"/>1 THe vſe of the Church of Rome, to haue the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Seruice and Prayers, and miniſtration of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, in an <hi>vnknowne tongue,</hi> is well enough knowne. This I affirmed to be againſt antiquitie, and a point wherein they haue altered the faith of the ancient Church. And firſt I alledged the words of Saint Paul; then the teſtimonie and confeſſion of other Eccleſiaſticall writers: to all which he anſwers nothing, but referres me to Bellarmine. In which abſurd courſe if I would imitate him, I might alſo referre him to ſuch as haue anſwered Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine: and the reader that expected to ſee the thing tried betweene vs, ſhould be deluded. Neuertheleſſe I will doe my beſt to bring this broode of darkneſſe to the light; and euery thing that I haue ſaid to the triall, that the truth may appeare, and the ſhame be theirs that turne their backes.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Firſt he ſayes, <hi>I will neuer be able ſoundly to proue, that the auncient Church condemned this their practiſe.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the Apoſtle condemnes it in the words
<note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 14.7.</note> alledged: <hi>If an inſtrument of muſicke make no diſtinction in the ſound, how ſhall it be knowne what is piped or harped? So likewiſe you, vnleſſe by the language you vtter words that haue ſignification, how ſhall it be vnderſtood what is ſpoken? for you ſhall ſpeake in the aire. I will pray and ſing with the ſpirit; and I will pray and ſing with the vnderſtanding alſo. Elſe when thou bleſſeſt with the Spirit, how ſhall he that occupies the roome of the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſay Amen, at thy giuing of thankes, ſeeing he knowes not what thou ſayeſt? I had rather in the Church to ſpeake fiue words with my vnderſtanding, that I might alſo inſtruct others, then a thouſand words in a ſtrange tongue.</hi> No enemie that the Church of Rome hath, can more fully condemne Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in an vnknowne language, nor in more effectuall termes ſpeake againſt it. For be requires all that which is done in the Church, be it Exhortation, Prophecie, Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Expounding, or Praying, to be done in a language that the people preſent vnderſtands, and rebukes the contrary. All that the Replier ſayes hereto, is, that <hi>Bellarmine hath
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:20570:255"/> ſhewed theſe words proue nothing.</hi> Which is his policie to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide the ſcanning of them: for he knowes, all the learned of his ſide be ſo deuided in their anſwer to theſe words, that whatſoeuer he ſhould ſay, would fall out to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that which others affirme. For the auoiding of which inconuenience, he referres vs to Bellarmine; as if in him we ſhould find a iuſt anſwer and full ſatisfaction. But he abuſes the Reader, as ſhall plainly appeare, by propounding the ſumme and ſubſtance of all that Bellarmine ſayes to the place. Firſt he ſayeth, <hi>It is certaine the Apoſtle,</hi> in a great part of this chapter, <hi>ſpeakes not of the reading of the Scripture, nor concerning the Seruice of the Church, but of certaine ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall exhortations and conferences then vſed.</hi> Touching this point, how true or falſe ſoeuer it be, I will not greatly ſtand with him: but then it is <hi>as certaine, that in a great part of this Chapter he ſpeakes of Church-ſeruice, and prayers, and of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Scripture,</hi> as well as of ſpirituall conferences and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. So his patron Gretſer, that hath lately vndertaken to defend all his writings, confeſſes,
<note n="c" place="margin">Gretſ. defenſ. Bellar. de verb. Dei. l. 2. c. 16. pag. 850. c. &amp; pag 918. A.</note> 
                  <hi>If you ſpeake of the whole Chapter, Bellarmine acknowledges the Apoſtle to speake, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of spirituall ſongs, and preaching, and exhortations, but of the reading the Scripture likewiſe, and publicke Seruice.</hi> Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that the Apoſtle condemnes the reading of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or prayer, and Church-ſeruice in a language not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as well as he doth preaching, collations and hymnes: for verſ. 26. he requires <hi>all things</hi> that he ſpeakes of, <hi>be done to edifying:</hi> and verſ. 6. he ſayes, <hi>If I come vnto you, ſpeaking with tongues,</hi> (that is, in a language you vnderſtand not) <hi>what ſhall I profit you?</hi> And verſ. 9. <hi>Except ye vtter words that can be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, you ſhall ſpeake in the aire.</hi> And verſ. 11. <hi>If I know not the meaning of the voice, he that ſpeakes ſhall be a Barbarian vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me.</hi> And verſ. 14. <hi>For if I pray in an vnknowne tongue, my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is vnfruitfull.</hi> And verſ. 16. <hi>How ſhall he that occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies the roome of the vnlearned, ſay</hi> AMEN <hi>at thy giuing of thanks, when he vnderſtands not what thou ſayſt? Thou giueſt thankes well, but the other is not edified.</hi> Hence I thus reaſon: The Apoſtle condemnes euery thing in the Church, whatſoeuer it be, that
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:20570:255"/> edifies not: But prayer, reading the Scripture, and Seruice in the Church, as well as preaching and ſpirituall ſongs in a language that the people preſent vnderſtand not, edifie not: Ergo he condemnes prayer, reading the Scripture, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in the Church, in a language that the people preſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not, as well as preaching and ſpirituall ſongs. The firſt propoſition is in verſ. 12.19.26: the ſecond in verſ. 6.14.16.17: the concluſion therefore is the Apoſtles. And indeed if our aduerſaries could haue ſhewed, that the <hi>prayers</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ver. 15, had bin ſuch <hi>ſpirituall ſongs,</hi> or <hi>preaching</hi> onely, as they expound: and then that the Apoſtle in all his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe had onely ſpoke of ſuch <hi>ſongs</hi> and <hi>preaching,</hi> and not of <hi>prayer, reading the Scripture,</hi> or <hi>Seruice</hi> in the Church alſo, they had had ſome colour for themſelues (though not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to auoid our argument;) but when he ſpeaks of theſe things alſo, by their owne confeſſion, and the whole intent of his doctrine is that ALL THE THINGS HE SPEAKES OF, be done with edification; it is deſperate peruerſneſſe to ſay, the text proues nothing againſt them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In the ſecond place therefore, when Bellarmine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not auoide it, but it is manifeſt the Apoſtle, at leaſt in ſome part of his diſcourſe, ſpeakes of <hi>ſinging,</hi> and <hi>prayers,</hi> and <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Scripture,</hi> which belong to Church-ſeruice; he fals to anſwering, and layes downe foure anſwers, whereof he caſts off three, and betakes himſelfe to the fourth. The firſt is, that by ſinging and praying, mentioned verſe 19. (where the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>I will pray and ſing with the spirit: and I will pray and ſing with vnderſtanding alſo: elſe how ſhall he that occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies the roome of the vnlearned ſay</hi> AMEN, <hi>when he vnderſtands not what thou ſayſt?</hi>) is meant <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>exhorting,</hi> not <hi>praying:</hi> a hard expoſition, when the common notion of the words is againſt it, and the Apoſtle manifeſtly diſtinguiſhes the one from the other, and men vſe not to ſay Amen to preaching: yet, moſt vntruly and diſhoneſtly, he fathers it on Baſil, Theodoret, and Sedulius:

And there can no reaſon be aſſigned, why then S.

               <p n="6">6 The negatiue part of Bellarmines anſwer is, that <hi>the Apoſtle ſpeakes not of Diuine Seruice, nor the publicke reading of the Scripture.</hi> I grant he ſpeakes not of ſuch Diuine Seruice as is now vſed: becauſe, I ſuppoſe, there was either no ſet forme of Seruice at all, the Church being yet vngrowne and in perſecution; or no ſuch forme as now is vſed. But of that forme that was then vſed he ſpeakes: that is to ſay, whatſoeuer forme of Seruice, and manner of praiers, was vſed in the congregation, he commands, euen in thoſe words, be done in a knowne language. The which if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliar denie I muſt put him in mind of that I haue ſaid before out of Gretſer: that <hi>in this Chapter he ſpeakes of reading the Scripture and the publicke Seruice.</hi> But it is certaine that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he ſpeakes of it, he requires they be done to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and expounds the edification by vnderſtanding the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage wherein they are done; in the ſame manner that here he ſpeakes of ſinging and praying. For therefore he mentions them, whereſoeuer it be, becauſe they were abuſed, and that abuſe was the vſing them in an vnknowne tongue: and this abuſe he condemnes, wiſhing them to ſpeake with edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:20570:258"/> which is al one whether he ſpeake of them in this place or in another. But let vs heare how Bellarmine proues the Apoſtle not to ſpeake of diuine ſeruice, or publike reading the Scripture, in this place: <hi>it is proued,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>by this that the Scriptures were read and the ſeruice done, in Greeke, becauſe it was a Greeke Church. But the Apoſtle speakes of ſomething that was done, not in the Greeke, but in ſome other vnknowne tongue.</hi> This auoids not our argument, for he cannot proue they had any ſet forme of liturgy at all.

But how doth the Ieſuite proue that, <hi>de facto</hi> it was done in the Greeke that all vnderſtood? we graunt, <hi>de iure</hi> it ought; but this is that we ſay: that when theſe men, indued with the gifts of tongues, came into the congregation, they would do it in ſtrange tongues, and not in Greeke; which is part of the abuſe that the Apoſtle ſpeakes againſt, requiring that if ſuch would omit the ordinary common language, and do the Church ſeruice, ſuch as it was, in a ſtrange language (as the ſpirituall ſongs mentioned were done) then let him ſpeake, and another interpret.

<pb n="474" facs="tcp:20570:259"/> why might not this ſinging, praying, and reading be part of the Church ſeruice that, at ſuch times, was vſed? Thirdly, let it be granted that he ſpeakes not of the ſeruice, but onely of that which was done extraordinarily, by miracle, then haue our aduerſaries to ſhew how the Apoſtles argument, againſt preaching and ſinging in a ſtrange tongue, holds not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe againſt Church ſeruice in a ſtrange tongue. Bellarmine, and Gretſer ſay, the <hi>principall end of thoſe spirituall and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſongs was the inſtruction and conſolation of the people: and therefore it was meete they ſhould vnderſtand them: but the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall end of Church ſeruice being to worſhip God, and the Prieſt hauing in charge to teach the people what they vnderſtand not: it is not needfull the ſaid ſeruice ſhould be in a knowne tongue.</hi> But this latter (that the Prieſt had in charge to teach the people what they vnderſtood not) is vntrue: for the Apoſtle will haue both Prieſt and people ioyned together: Thou verily giueſt thankes well, but thy brother is not edified. Neither would I require any better argument for my aſſertion then this. For if the end of Church ſeruice be <hi>Gods worſhip,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people muſt vnderſtand it, that they may worſhippe God. For this worſhip ſtands not in rehearſing Latin words, but when the people by thoſe words learne to know Gods wil and their own duty: and offer him vp the requiſite moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their hearts: which in an vnknowne tong they cannot do. And if, ſecondly, the Prieſt be to expound the meaning of that which is done in the Liturgy, then they are bound to vſe it in a knowne language: both becauſe they cannot giue the meaning without interpreting the language; and that interpreting, when it comes to execution and practiſe, will proue farre more difficult and obnoxious to danger and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, then the ſimple reading in a knowne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Hitherto I haue ſtood to cleare the Apoſtles text that I alledged, from the anſwers that Bellarmine hath made thereto. But beſide that text, I ſhewed by a place in Origen,

What could I do more, or what can an aduerſary require more, then by ſo ſufficient witneſſes to proceede in my aſſertion?

                  <hi>It is demanded whether the ſacred Scriptures may be tranſlated into the mother tongue of euery nation, that euery one may the better reade and vnderſtand them? I anſwer, that Lutherans and Caluiniſts are in that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that they affirme the ſacred Scripture ought to be tranſlated into the vulgar Languages of all nations: againſt whom the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent, in the fourth rule, thus hath:</hi> And ſo repeats the conſtitution as I haue ſet it downe. That conſtitution therefore forbids the tranſlation, and vſe of the Scripture in the vulgar tongue, as I haue ſaid. Then he goes forward. <hi>The Gospells and Epiſtles, which are read in the Church through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the yeare, may not be printed alone, but with the expoſitions of the Catholicke authors vpon them — and all praier bookes, containing Pſalms and canticles of the Scripture, in the vulgar tongue, are likewiſe forbidden</hi> — But, <hi>is it expedient and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to haue the ſacred volumes tranſlated into the mother tongues?
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:20570:262"/> I anſwer, No. Becauſe therby the vnity of beleeuers would ſuſtaine detriment: then much ignorance and folly would inſue in the Church, beſides, diuers cauſes of errors and hereſies would ariſe. Moreouer the vncertainetie and multitude of tranſlations</hi> (yet there is not more varietie and vncertainety in any tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons then among their owne Latine ones) <hi>would cauſe innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable contentions, quarrells, and other diſcommodities and euils, almoſt infinite.</hi> Thus, moſt immodeſtly and heretically they make thoſe exceptions againſt the Scripture, that in their conſcience they know the primitiue Church neuer made: and raking into all the abuſes of the Scripture that they can finde, mens deprauing, miſexpounding, miſapplying them; vſing them ouer boldly, malepartly, not with the reſpect they ſhould; hence moſt diſhoneſtly they conclude the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuppreſſing of them: not that they care how they are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (for neuer any vſed them ſo vilely as themſelues either
<note n="*" place="margin">PRVRITA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NVS.</note> in applying, reuiling; or corrupting them) but becauſe they are mad at that which diſcouers their hereſie.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The Reply, to ſalue the matter, ſayes, that <hi>if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties dispoſition be ſuch that he may take benefit, and no harme, by reading, then they permit the Scripture in the mother tongue both to laie men and women.</hi> This is not true: for how do they <hi>permit</hi> it to ſuch, where (as in Spaine) there is <hi>permitted</hi> no tranſlation at all? how it is permitted when the Pope ſayes, <hi>none may reade but ſuch as are licenced by the</hi> Biſhops: and <hi>this power of licencing, is taken from him by the Inquiſition?</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, euen by making this reſtraint, they are gone from the primitiue Church which gaue rules, &amp; had diſcipline to reſtraine ſuch as abuſed the Scripture: but the liberty of the booke it ſelfe they neuer reſtrained, nor euer bound the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt that was, to go to the Biſhop for a licence; but by how much the more he was ignorant, or tranſported with pride, or indangered with hereſie; by ſo much the more they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him to reade the Scripture to reforme himſelfe: and if he did not, they onely preached againſt his abuſe, and puniſht the man, but the tranſlation they ſuppreſſed not. And all the Papiſts in Europe, in all the writings of the firſt 600

<note n="m" place="margin">Tom. 1. pag. 893. c.</note> anſwers, <hi>There is not the ſame reaſon of Chriſtians, that there was of the Iewes:</hi> and why ſo? <hi>the Iewes beleeued not in Chriſt, but oppoſed both his doctrine and perſon: whereas he that is a true Chriſtian beleeues Chriſt and honours him.</hi> This is true, that is ſaid both of the Iewes, and Chriſtians: but this difference is no reaſon why a beleeuing Chriſtian may not ſearch the Scripture as well as an vnbeleeuing Iew. For the Chriſtian, though he beleeue in Chriſt, yet is ignorant of much of his wil, or weake in faith, or aſſailed with hereſies increaſing in the world, or deſirous to confirme himſelfe and others in the truth: in which caſes let the Ieſuite ſhew, why Chriſt for the curing of the Iew ſhould allow him to reade the Scripture; and yet debar the Chriſtian, whoſe ſtate needes the ſupport of the Scripture one way, as much as the ſtate of the Iew doth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Nay this is a good argument againſt himſelfe and my Repliar. For if the reaſon why the laity may not reade the Scripture be becauſe our Sauiour hath commanded vs <hi>not to giue holy things to dogges, nor to caſt pearles before hogges:</hi> and the Iewes not beleeuing Chriſt but oppoſing his doctrine and perſon, be more dogges and hogges then Chriſtians; hence it will follow roundly, that the Scripture is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Chriſtians much more then to the Iewes, becauſe the Iewes were permitted to reade the Scriptures, though they were dogges and hogges.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Secondly he ſayes, that allowing it to containe <hi>an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute precept</hi> (which he doth as a child kiſſes the rod (for he muſt do it, if he wil follow the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of the Doctors) yet <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an affirmatiue precept, it obliges not all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor at all times, but may be limited to particular times</hi> (as to the time of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church) <hi>&amp; to particular perſons</hi> (as now only the Clergy) <hi>and other circumſtances,</hi> which the Church of Rome ſhal think meet. I anſwer, affirmatiue precepts firſt binde all perſons to whom they are giuen. Secondly, they binde at all ſuch times as the matter therein contained agrees vnto. Thirdly, they
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:20570:264"/> receiue limitation or reſtraint, from none but from the lawgiuer himſelfe; in all which properties they agree with negatiue commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: &amp; therefore, omitting all intricate diſcourſe touching this matter, the precept of ſearching the Scripture binding in this manner, it is ſufficient, for the allowance thereof to the people. For firſt, they that <hi>cannot reade</hi> may fulfill it by hearing it read. <hi>Searching</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained no more to the one, then to the other. Secondly, there is none, but by <hi>ſearching,</hi> that is to ſay by diligent la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, may vnderſtand them in their mother tongue, better then in Hebrew. Becauſe I haue ſhewed many times ouer, that the articles of faith, and rules of good life, are ſet downe ſo plainely, that the ſimpleſt may vnderſtand them; vnleſſe he will make lay people ſo ſenceleſſe that they haue not the common light of nature. Thirdly, we binde not <hi>euery man,</hi> to reade <hi>all the Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>at all houres,</hi> doing nothing elſe: becauſe there is no ſuch thing in the precept. Then I haue <hi>ſatisfied</hi> his <hi>queſtions,</hi> and admit a <hi>limitation,</hi> in things wherein the precept limits <hi>it ſelfe:</hi> but how followes this? Affirmatiue precepts haue their limitations, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the Pope</hi> may limit them. Or this?

<note place="margin">Pag. 281.</note> that the Church of Rome worſhippeth, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth men to worſhip them, with the very ſame <hi>diuine</hi> honour which is due to God himſelfe: firſt, no man holdeth that the images of Saints are to beworſhipped with the <hi>very ſame</hi> diuine honour which is due to God, becauſe the Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, being more honoured of vs then their images, are not honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>diuine</hi> honour. Secondly, although <hi>ſome</hi> ſay, that the image of Chriſt is to be worſhipped with the ſame honour that the Prototy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon is; yet theſe be but <hi>ſome,</hi> and that which is ſaid by theſe <hi>ſome,</hi> is not ſo to be vnderſtood as M. White ſeemeth willing to make his Reader beleeue; as though they meant, that the <hi>verie</hi> honour, due to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, ſhould be giuen to the image it ſelfe, which cannot be, vnleſſe we ſhould be ſo fooliſh as to conceaue and iudge that the image it ſelfe were indeed Chriſt the Sonne of God, which none that hath learned the firſt rudiments of Chriſtianity can conceaue and iudge. Thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that vſe that manner of ſpeech, do onely meane that the image is worſhipped with the ſame worſhip onely <hi>improperly</hi> and <hi>per accident</hi> or at the moſt <hi>Analogicè.</hi> All which manners are farre from giuing any diuine honour euen to the image of Chriſt himſelfe, as will appeare by only declaring what it is to giue worſhip to an image <hi>improperly,</hi> and what <hi>per accidens,</hi> and what to giue it <hi>Analogicè:</hi> the which I thinke good to declare in this place becauſe I imagine if Proteſtants did but rightly vnderſtand our doctrine, in this and other ſuch points, they would not be ſo much auerted from it as, through the ſlanderous miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reports of our aduerſaries, now they are: Note therefore firſt, that we are ſaid to worſhip an image <hi>improperly</hi> when as we take it <hi>obiectiue</hi> and make it the vicegerent of the thing conſidered as abſent or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, by it repreſenting to our minde the thing it ſelfe, no otherwiſe then in a Comedy, or Play, the perſon of the king may be repreſented by another perſon: to whom, in this caſe, all due reſpect of ſpeech may be made as if he were the king himſelfe. In which caſe notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the honour is <hi>properly</hi> done onely to the king, and is onely <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly</hi> done to the perſon, which repreſenteth him. In this manner it is that Preachers, ſometimes fixing their eies on the image of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixe, direct their ſpeech to Chriſt himſelfe, not that they thinke, or would haue the people to thinke, that the crucifixe is Chriſt, more then thoſe that make ſuch a Comedy, or Play as I ſpeake of, do thinke, or would haue others to thinke, that the perſon which repreſenteth the king is the very king himſelfe, or that the honour is done to him as to one conceaued really to be the king himſelfe. In this manner alſo it is that on good-fryday in Catholicke countries they adore, and creepe to the Croſſe. For all this adoration and creeping is exhibited (proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking) onely to Chriſt himſelfe: and none of this honour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is giuen to the croſſe it ſelfe: the which <hi>vnproper</hi> manner of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring the croſſe or crucifixe is no more iniutious or preiudiciall to
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:20570:268"/> the honour of God then the kneeling, which might be made in ſuch a Comedy to him that repreſenteth the kings perſon, or which men vſe to make before the Chaire of Eſtate, is iniurious or preiudiciall to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the king. Neither are Chriſtian people more likely, by theſe cuſtomes of the Church, to fall into idolatry, by conceauing images to be the very thing which is adored as God, or as a Saint: hauing both their Paſtors inſtruction, and their owne reaſon and faith to tell them the contrary; then kings ſubiects are in danger, by the foreſaid Plaies, or the cuſtome of kneeling to the Chaire of Eſtate, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit treaſon in conceauing the Plaier, or Chaire, to be the king and giuing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſoueraigne duety to the Plaier or to the Chaire, as to the very king: in regard their owne reaſon, and but ordinary inſtruction, will teach them that the Plaier, or Chaire, is not the king, himſelfe, and that the reſpect giuen to them is not giuen to them as to the very king. Note ſecondly, that we are ſaid to worſhip an image <hi>per accidens,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we do not thus take the image <hi>obiectiue,</hi> as vicegerent of the thing conſidered, as abſent, or diſtant, but when as we conſider the thing it ſelfe preſented, and as it were veſted, with the image, or ſhining to vs in the image: as it happeneth to vnlearned men, who ſometimes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not frame a conceipt of Chriſt crucified but by meanes of the outward image: and as it happeneth to all men, who in this life (at leaſt ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) cannot vnderſtand any thing but by meanes of the inward images of their imagination and phantaſie, according to that of Ariſtotle: <hi>Opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet intelligentem phantaſmata ſpeculari.</hi> In this caſe the adoration which we make at the ſight of the image is, <hi>per ſe loquendo:</hi> onely exhibited to the thing, yet it may be ſaid to be giuen <hi>per accidens</hi> to the image: no otherwiſe then when we bow downe to the king cloathed in his Princely robes, our bowing, <hi>per ſe loquendo,</hi> is only to the kings perſon, yet it may be ſaid to be done <hi>per accidens</hi> to his robes. Note thirdly, that we may be ſaid to giue the ſame honour to the image which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the thing <hi>Analogice,</hi> to wit, the ſame in <hi>name</hi> not in <hi>nature,</hi> the ſame in <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of proportion not in <hi>ſubſtance</hi> or <hi>equalitie</hi> of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: which I explicate thus: To an image, being a thing without life, or vnderſtanding, properly ſpeaking, there is not due, either <hi>latria, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perdulia,</hi> or <hi>dulia,</hi> or any other, ſo much as ciuill worſhip, of the <hi>ſame</hi> nature, ſubſtance, or equalitie, which is due to the thing which it may repreſent, but a farre inferiour manner of worſhip, proportionably more, or leſſe, as the thing which it repreſenteth is more or leſſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie: the which, although thus it be farre inferiour to the worſhip due to the thing it ſelfe: yet in regard it is giuen, onely for the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, or relation it hath to the thing, it may after a ſort, partake the name of the worſhip, due to the very thing: and may in a ſecondary manner, be reduced to it: thereby being diſtinguiſhed from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip due to other images, and receauing more, or leſſe, morall dignity, then is in the worſhip due to other images. This to be ſo, is prooued,
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:20570:268"/> becauſe that what proportion there is betwixt the image, and the thing whereof it is the image, the ſame is betwixt the worſhip due to the image, and the worſhip due to the thing. But firſt, the image is not the ſame with the thing, in nature, ſubſtance, or equalitie of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but far inferiour. Ergo the worſhip due to the thing, and due to the image, is not the ſame in nature, ſubſtance, and equalitie of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but far inferiour. Secondly, the image may haue the name of the thing, and may be reduced, in a ſecondarie manner to the kinde of the thing; thereby being diſtinguiſhed from other images, and to receiue proportionablie more, or leſſe morall dignity, then other images haue. Ergo, the worſhip due to the image may, in a ſort, haue the name, and may, in a ſecondarie manner, be reduced to the worſhip of the thing, thereby being diſtinguiſhed from the worſhip due to other images, receiuing alſo more, or leſſe morall dignity, then is in the worſhip due to other images. This explication may ſeeme perhaps too ſubtill for euery ones capacitie; as indeed it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intended by me for the ſatisfaction of more pregnant, and iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wits. For the ſimple ſort, it may ſuffice to vnderſtand, firſt, that in truth, and ſpeaking properly, none of vs hold, that <hi>the ſame,</hi> but an <hi>inferiour</hi> kind of honor is due to the image, then is due to the thing, whoſe image it is. Secondly, that to giue ſuch an inferiour kinde of worſhip to images, proportionably more, or leſſe, as we eſteeme, more or leſſe, the thing whereof it is an image, is no way to be miſliked. For we ſee that euery one beareth ſome kind of ciuill reſpect to the very picture of his friend, proportionably more or leſſe, as, in a ciuill amity, he loueth his friend more or leſſe, ſetting it in a decent place &amp;c. The which reſpect to his friends picture is no way any hinderance, but rather a great helpe to ſhew, and increaſe his reſpect to his friend, in his owne perſon; and cannot be accounted iniurious but gratefull to his friend: Euen ſo the inferiour kinde of religious reuerence, and reſpect, which we giue to the image of Chriſt, and his Saints, more or leſſe, this reuerence and reſpect (I ſay) done to the images reliques, &amp;c. is ſo far from being a hinderance to the reuerence, and reſpect due to Chriſt himſelfe, or to his Saints: as rather it much helpeth vs to ſhew, and ſo to practiſe, and ſo to increaſe our reuerence, and reſpect to Chriſt himſelfe, and to his Saints: and therefore cannot be thought iniurious,
<note n="*" place="margin">See Bellar. l. de imag. c. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19.</note> but very gratefull vnto them. Now vnderſtanding our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and practiſe about worſhipping of images in this manner, M. White doth not, nor euer will be able ſufficiently to proue, or ſhew, it to be vnlawfull, or contrary either to Scriptures, or to the doctrine of the ancient Church. The proofes which he bringeth are either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, or of ſmall moment, or are anſwered already by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Authors.</q>

                  <pb n="494" facs="tcp:20570:269"/>1 THe firſt example, wherein the Digreſſion ſhewed the Church of Rome to hold contrary to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, was in the point of IMAGES: breefly producing diuers plaine teſtimonies out of the Scripture, and other Eccleſiaſticall writers, whereby it appeares that the vſe and worſhip of images, now ſo ſolemne in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church, was not permitted in thoſe daies. My Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie replies: <hi>The proofes which I bring, are either imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, or of ſmall moment, or are anſwered already by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke authors.</hi> His author is Bellarmine, quoted in his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; but therefore M. White, made choiſe of this point, to ſee who, of all his Aduerſaries, would ſtep forth and firſt propound Bellarmines anſwers, and then maintaine them againſt that which would be replied. This had bene a directer courſe then thus, euery where, to refer me to his bookes, whereby the Reader can take no benefit. For I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo can as eaſily refer him to the bookes of thoſe that haue anſwered all that Bellarmine ſaies. His reaſon rendred why the authorities and <hi>proofs</hi> produced ſhould be <hi>impertinent,</hi> and <hi>of ſmall moment,</hi> is, becauſe we do not <hi>rightly vnderſtand</hi> the <hi>doctrine and practiſe</hi> of the Church of Rome <hi>about wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of images,</hi> but <hi>ſlanderouſly miſreport</hi> it: therefore he will <hi>declare</hi> it, that it may appeare to be neither <hi>vnlawfull,</hi> nor <hi>contrary to the Scripture, or doctrine of the ancient Church.</hi> That which he ſayes touching our <hi>not rightly vnderſtanding</hi> the doctrine, may be true. For the idolatrie is ſo groſſe, that the diſtinctions and trickes, inuented to defend it, are ſuch as themſelues vnderſtand not: and the three things, here noted by himſelfe, are the very nice diſtinctions whereof
<note n="a" place="margin">De imag. c. 22.</note> Bellarmine and
<note n="b" place="margin">De Trad. p. 226.</note> Pereſius confeſſe, that neither the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple nor themſelues vnderſtand or conceiue them, or if they do, yet they
<note n="*" place="margin">Nec poſſunt niſi errando in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligere.</note> erre in doing it. That it is no maruell if we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not that which they vnderſtand not themſelues. But that the proofes alledged in the Digreſſion are <hi>imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi> and of <hi>ſmall moment,</hi> is eaſily ſaid, but not ſo eaſily ſhewed. For three things I am ſure the Replier will grant me: yea he grants them expreſly in his diſcourſe. Firſt, that
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:20570:269"/> in his Church they haue and vſe images. Secondly, that they worſhip them, at leaſt with ſome kinde of worſhip, either <hi>ciuill,</hi> or <hi>diuine.</hi> Thirdly, that ſome kind of images, they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with diuine honor, at leaſt with a diſtinction: either <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,</hi> or <hi>improperly:</hi> or <hi>respectiuely,</hi> or <hi>accidently,</hi> or <hi>vniuocally,</hi> or <hi>equiuocally,</hi> or <hi>analogically.</hi> Now the authorities alledged ſhew that none of all this was done and allowed in the Primitiue Church: neither <hi>the ſetting vp</hi> of images in the Church: nor the <hi>worſhipping them with ciuil worſhip:</hi> nor the worſhipping of any of them with <hi>diuine worſhip, with any diſtinction</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. And therefore the Replie, by running into this irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and wilde explication of their doctrine, doth but put a tricke on the Reader. For the Digreſſion produced the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, not onely againſt worſhipping of the images of Chriſt, and God, with diuine honor, <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,</hi> but againſt worſhipping them with diuine honor, in ſuch manner, as he confeſſes it is giuen; <hi>improperly, accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, analogically;</hi> and ſecondly, againſt worſhipping any images at all, either with <hi>latria,</hi> or <hi>dulia,</hi> or <hi>hyperdulia.</hi> And thirdly, againſt the very ſetting them vp in the Church, for any end whatſoeuer. Now he, by running into his diſtinctions, makes ſhew as if nothing were required for anſwering me, but onely to ſhew that they worſhip images with diuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; onely; <hi>improperly,</hi> and <hi>accidentally,</hi> or at the moſt <hi>analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically.</hi> The which if he could ſhew neuer ſo ſubſtantially (which he cannot) yet when he had done, he had alſo to ſhew the other three points: That neither the ſetting vp, nor adoring ciuillie, nor adoring with Gods honor impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, accidentally, and analogically, were againſt the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe and doctrine of the Primitiue Church, ſhewed in thoſe authorities.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Omitting therefore that which moſt properly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, he onely meddles with that I ſaid touching <hi>the worſhipping images with diuine honor, the very ſame that is due to God.</hi> And firſt he ſaies, <hi>no man holds that the images of Saints</hi> are <hi>ſo</hi> to be worſhipt, becauſe <hi>the Saints themſelues are not worſhipped with diuine honor:</hi> and in his margent, he ſhewes,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:20570:270"/> how in the firſt impreſſion of my Booke, I ſaid <hi>abſolutely without limitation,</hi> the Church of Rome worſhips <hi>images</hi> with the ſame honor that belongs to God: but in the ſecond edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I added a limitation: the Church of Rome worſhips <hi>images (ſome of them)</hi> with the ſame honor: the which, he ſaies, I added <hi>for ſhame.</hi> I anſwer, the addition was not for <hi>ſhame,</hi> as if there were any images in their Church which are not worſhipt with diuine honor, but for the more perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, to point at thoſe images which I would moſt challenge. And if he will not allow me thus much without controle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let the ſhame follow the chiefeſt writers in his owne Church. Stapleton, Suarez, Valentian, and his Briarly, who all in their latter editions haue added many things, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine the former: and, with a witneſſe, let him reach it Bellarmine for his <hi>recognitions.</hi> I am ſo far from being aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of that I ſaid, <hi>They worſhip images,</hi> (yea images of Saints) <hi>with diuine honour,</hi> that I am contented the three words, added in the ſecond impreſſion, be razed out againe. For doth he thinke we are ſo blinde, that becauſe in words they renounce it, therefore we cannot diſcerne of their deeds? is it enough to diſcharge them when they <hi>ſay</hi> they worſhip them onely with an inferior honor, called <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="4">4 It is certen therefore, that it is the doctrine of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church of Rome, that images are worſhipped with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine honour, ſuch as God himſelfe is worſhipped with. Now let vs go forward. The Reply anſwers, that the meaning is, that the honour is the ſame, <hi>onely improperly, by accident, or at the moſt analogically:</hi> and therefore it is not diuine honour. And ſo falles to <hi>declaring what it is to worſhip an image improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by accident, and analogically.</hi> But afore we come to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, let the reader haue his eye vpon the point, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member he hath two things to ſhew. Firſt, that this impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>accidentary</hi> and <hi>analogicall</hi> honour, is not diuine honour, ſuch as is due to God onely. Secondly, that the ancient Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church condemned it not, but allowed it, as the Church of Rome now doth. The which two things being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies kept in minde, go we forward to his
<note n="*" place="margin">This his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration is Bellarmines, de imag. c. 20.</note> declaration. Firſt,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:20570:271"/> he ſaies: they worſhippe the images of Chriſt, not <hi>per ſe,</hi> by themſelues, but <hi>by accident:</hi> not properly, but <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly:</hi> or at the moſt <hi>analogically.</hi> Next he expounds this. The image is worſhipped <hi>improperly</hi> when it is <hi>taken obiectiuè, and made the vicegerent of the thing,</hi> whereof it is an image, <hi>to repreſent the ſame to our minde:</hi> as Tarleton, in a play, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the perſon of a king: and not properly in reſpect of it ſelfe. Secondly, it is worſhipped <hi>by accident,</hi> when it is not the <hi>ſuppoſitum</hi> wherein the reaſon of the worſhip is, but is ioyned to it, and is the thing whereby it is worſhipped, and <hi>wherewith it is veſted, and wherein it ſhines to vs.</hi> As the Princes robes are bowed to, becauſe <hi>the perſon of the Prince is clothed</hi> in them. Thirdly, it is worſhipt <hi>analogically,</hi> in that the ſame honour is giuen it that is giuen to Chriſt; <hi>not in nature, but in name; not in ſubſtance, or equality of perfection; but in ſimilitude of proportion: when for the reſemblance and relation it hath to</hi> Chriſt <hi>it partakes the name of his owne worſhip, and is reduced to it; and ſo receiues more morall dignity,</hi> and is of a higher proportion, <hi>then is the worſhip due to other images.</hi> This <hi>explication</hi> denies ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or the croſſe, to be adored properly, for themſelues, or with Gods worſhip the ſame in nature, ſubſtance, or equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and affirmes them to be adored onely as the vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of Chriſt, which repreſent him, and by relation are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him; and that with the ſame worſhip only in name, ſimilitude, and proportion. I anſwer three things. Firſt, theſe diſtinctions are but the late inuentions of our Aduerſaries, to hide their idolatry, nether can they either vnderſtand them themſelues, or make others vnderſtand them; or if they can, yet can they not hereby free themſelues from error.

<note n="h" place="margin">Vbi ſup q. 25. art. 3. ſee Caiet. vpon the place.</note> His concluſion is, <hi>ſeeing Chriſt is to be adored with diuine worſhip, his image alſo muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored with the ſame worſhip.</hi> His ground is, <hi>Becauſe the motion of the minde is one and the ſame to the image and the ſamplar.</hi> And expounds how: <hi>when the minde conceaues the image, onely as a meere thing, then the motion is two-fold: one to the image, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the thing: but when it conceaues it as an image of another thing, then the motion is one and the ſelfe ſame, both to the image, and to the thing ſignified by it.</hi> Hence I thus reaſon. So as Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas intended the motion of the minde to be one and the ſame, both to the image and the ſamplar; ſo, and in the ſame manner, did he intend the adoration to both, to be the ſame: But its cleare he intended the motion of the minde to be one and the ſame to both; not improperly or accidentarily, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogically; but the ſame to both, in nature and definition. Therefore it is cleare he inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the adoration to both, to be one and the ſame not improperly, accidentarily, or analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, but in nature and definition. You will poſſible demand what it is then that Thomas, and his ſectaries truely hold touching this matter? I anſwer, they hold 4. things. Firſt, that images are to be adored with the ſame honor that is due to the ſamplar. Secondly, that therefore the images of Chriſt, and his croſſe muſt be adored with diuine honour, the ſame that belongs to Chriſt himſelfe. Thirdly, that this diuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is not diuine onely in name, and analogy, but indeed and vniuocally. For that being the expoſition of
<note n="i" place="margin">3. d. 9. qu. vnic. concl. 6.</note> Gabriell, is reiected of all hands. Fourthly, that this honour is giuen the image reſpctiuely for Chriſt, thereby to honor him, &amp; to conuey their ſeruice to him: &amp; not for the images own ſake. He that reades Thomas, and the Ieſuites, ſhall finde this to be true: wherein they haue onely the laſt point to helpe themſelues, and wherewith to excuſe their idolatry. But it doth them no good; forſomuch as the Iewes worſhipping
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:20570:272"/> the calfe, and the Gentiles adoring their idols, did it not for the images owne ſake, but reſpectiuely and intentionally to God, vſing the image but as an inſtrument to conuey their ſeruice to him; yet notwithſtanding for ſo much as in this manner, they imparted diuine adoration to the image, by creeping, bowing capping, kneeling, informed alſo by reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious motions of the heart;

               <p n="6">6 Neuertheleſſe, to ſhew that images may be adored with the diuine honour of Chriſt, <hi>improperly, accidentally</hi> and <hi>analogically,</hi> as he hath diſtinguiſhed, he reaſons thus: the worſhipping of <hi>a crucifixe</hi> or image in this maner, and <hi>the creeping to the croſſe,</hi> as <hi>in Catholicke countries it is vſed on Good-fridayes:</hi> is no more then kneeling to the chaire of eſtate, or to one that in a Play repreſents the Kings perſon. But to kneele to the chaire of eſtate, or to one that in a play repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Kings perſon, is no treaſon, or preiudiciall to the honor of the King. Therefore the worſhipping of Chriſts i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, in this maner, is no idolatrie, nor preiudiciall to the honor of Chriſt. I anſwer, denying the propoſition: there is not the like reaſon in worſhipping the image of Chriſt, that there is in kneeling to the chaire of eſtate, or to him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the Kings perſon: they are not equall. The compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon doth well ſhew and explicate, how it is poſſible to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Chriſt in the crucifixe, and the crucifixe for Chriſt: but it doth not proue this to be lawfull. For it is true that the chaire of eſtate is in a ſort vnited to the perſon of the King, and the perſon of the King is by a certaine habitude vnited to him that repreſents him. But how will the Replier proue, that ſo alſo Chriſt is vnited to the image. I know the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his conceit vnites them; but who hath taught him ſo to do? what law, what word, what promiſe of God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed any ſuch vnion, or allowed him to conceiue it? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly it is true, the chaire of eſtate, or he that repreſents the King, and the King himſelfe, may be conceiued both together with one thought, and they may be reuerenced both together with one worſhip; the one <hi>properly,</hi> the other
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:20570:273"/> 
                  <hi>improperly:</hi> but thus to conceiue, and thus to worſhip Chriſt and his image together, is the thing that I ſay is forbidden, and was condemned in the Primitiue Church. Thirdly, it is alſo true, that the chaire of eſtate or the embaſſador are not worſhipped properly, becauſe they are not worſhipped at al, but the King onely in them: but the worſhip giuen to the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, is bounded in the image it ſelf, as it is an image: and if it were not, but Chriſt onely were worſhipped before the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, as God was before the Arke, yet that practiſe hath no warrant. Albeit therefore there be, as the Reply ſpeakes, no danger in kneeling to the embaſſador or chaire of the King, but it may be done without treaſon, or preiudice to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; yet is it not ſo in the worſhip of images: firſt becauſe the one is ciuill, the other religious worſhip; and that may be done without treaſon in the one, that cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out idolatry in the other. Secondly Gods word permits the one, but no where the other. Thirdly, the chaire and embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador are ſignes of the Kings preſence; but the image is no ſigne (ordained or allowed ſo to be) of Chriſts preſence, neither is Chriſt any way vnited to it by his own ordinance, but onely by the worſhippers idolatrous intention. And it is ſo true, that nothing may be adored with God, that is not really vnited to him;

               <p n="8">8 His ſecond reaſon is this: <hi>The thing wherewith Chriſt is veſted, and wherein he ſhines as a Prince clothed in his robe, and without which he cannot ſo eaſily be conceiued, may and muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be worſhipped with him: But ſuch is the image of Chriſt, that he is veſted with it, &amp;c. Ergo.</hi> This argument lies couched in his ſecond note: or if it do not, then all he ſayes there, is to no purpoſe: for to what end ſhould he ſhew, by the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture</hi> and <hi>robes</hi> wherewith a Prince is <hi>veſted,</hi> and by the <hi>phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſmes</hi> mentioned, whereby things are conceiued, how the image may accidentally be conceiued and adored with Chriſt; if by the ſame things he intend not to proue the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of that adoration? I anſwer therfore, firſt as I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that theſe examples will ſerue to ſhew, how it is <hi>poſſible</hi> to worſhip an image onely accidentally, but not how it is <hi>lawfull.</hi> Secondly, the doctrine of the Church of Rome, is, that all images are worſhipped <hi>more then accidentally or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly:</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Bel. c. 21.2. ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> 
                  <hi>They are worſhipped of themſelues properly, ſo that themſelues are the obiect of the worſhip, as they are conſidered in themſelues, and not onely as they are vicegerents of the ſamplar.</hi> He meanes not they are thus worſhipped with diuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, but with ſome honour of another kind: yet he ſhewes the Replier to ſay falſe, that they are worſhipped onely acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally. Nay by this concluſion it muſt be holden, that they are worſhipped <hi>for themſelues</hi> (as images) and <hi>properly,</hi> with <hi>diuine honour:</hi> becauſe all the worſhip giuen them, is
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:20570:274"/> to worſhip Chriſt withall: and no man may worſhip Chriſt, but with diuine honor. Now if the Church of Rome honor the crucifix in a higher degree then the Kings robe is hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; what facultie is there in the robe to proue the honor of the crucifixe? Thirdly it is vtterly falſe, that an image is the veſture of Chriſt, or that his maieſtie ſhines to vs in it: it is rather the veſture of Satan, wherein he ſhewes himſelfe to all that worſhip it, whoſe image ſoeuer it be. Fourthly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing that by <hi>phantaſmes</hi> I come to the conceiuing of things, and ſee not the King but <hi>veſted</hi> in his <hi>robe,</hi> and in my vnderſtanding, the image is not conceiued without Chriſt, but the motion of my mind is one to both, as to the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſmes and the things, to the robe and the King: yet I do not conceiue them <hi>as one,</hi> but <hi>as diſtinct</hi> things; conceiuing the robe to be a robe, the king to be a king, the image to be an image, and Chriſt to be God: whereupon it followes, that the adoration following the conception, I need not nor muſt adore any more then I conceiue to be capable of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which the robe and the image is not. Durand, whom Gerſon
<note n="b" place="margin">To. 1. p. 559. e.</note> thinkes to be one of them that haue written <hi>moſt purely and ſubſtantially,</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">3. d. 9. q. 2.</note> ſayes, <hi>Though the motion of the minde be one and the ſame to the image and the thing whereof it is an image, yet the mind neuer ſays the image is the thing, but alway di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes between them: and therefore</hi> the worſhip <hi>giuen to the thing, is neuer giuen to the image.</hi> The Repliers argument there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may wel proceed in that opinion that holds Chriſt to be worſhipped only before an image, though ſo alſo it iuſtifies it not; but it cannot conclude that worſhip, either diuine or any at all, muſt in any ſence be giuen to the image; becauſe the mind conceiuing both at once, yet vnderſtands the image to be a block, and Chriſt to be God. To the ſame effect writes Pereſius a profeſſor of Diuinitie among our aduerſaries:
<note n="a" place="margin">Tradit. p. 224.</note> 
                  <hi>Though we may be caried with one and the ſame knowledge to the image and the ſamplar, yet is it not hence concluded that the ſame may be done in worſhipping and adoring them: for there is great diſſimilitude betweene this and that. For it is not repugnant to an image, as it is an image, to be conceiued with the ſame knowledge
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:20570:274"/> wherewith the thing repreſented is knowne: but it ſeemes to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the nature of an image, as it is an image, that it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced with the ſame reuerence wherewith the ſamplar is, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it exceeds not the limits of an inſenſible creature:</hi> and of this compariſon of a Kings robe, he ſayes, <hi>There is no likeneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene an image and the robes of an Emperor.</hi>

Secondly I anſwer, and haue ſhewed before, that the Church of Rome worſhippeth images in a higher degree then with analogicall worſhip. For it was

<note n="e" place="margin">Azor. tom. 1. l. 9. c. 6.</note> that which is <hi>the conſtant iudgement of the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Diuines,</hi> is a lie, and comes from the father of lies, and ſhall be puniſhed accordingly by him that hates all lies; peſtilent hypocrites thus to maintaine that, in whole volumes, which themſelues know not to be the truth.

But let him take heed, that while he labours to pleaſe Chriſt and his Saints, he diſpleaſe not Thomas and his diſciples: for he knowes they cannot abide this inferiour worſhip; but <hi>ſeeing the motion of the mind is one and the ſame</hi> to Chriſt and his image, they will haue <hi>the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to both, be one and the ſame.</hi> And howſoeuer they take the matter, let the Replier go roundly to the point, and ſhew how this <hi>gratifying</hi> Chriſt with his <hi>inferiour</hi> worſhip, was <hi>gatefull</hi> to the ancient Church?

This I denie. Gregorie hath raked together all the places he could heare of, in antiquitie, to giue ſome colour to miniſtration in one kind; and hath moſt leudly beſtowed his wit to auoid the authorities that ſhew the contrary: but it cannot be proued, either that the thing is indifferent, or
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:20570:278"/> that the Church ſolemnely in the congregations vſed but one kind, as the Church of Rome now doth; or that the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of ſuch particular perſons as he pretends, was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the doctrine of the Church: which are the things whereupon the true iudgement of this queſtion depends.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But this it is: the B. of Rome and his Church, are now growne to that height of preſumption, that whatſoeuer Chriſt inſtituted and practiſed himſelfe, and commended to his Church; and the Church accordingly practiſed and taught many generations after him: yet by vertue of the chaire, and vnder pretence that he hath power to diſpence and vary in diuers things; any thing may be altered, without changing the ancient faith. But ſay, good ſtudent, ſay direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what reaſon can be aſſigned why the vſe of the cup ſhould be leſſe commanded by Chriſt, then the vſe of the bread? and why Chriſt ſhould be thought to haue left the cup indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent more then the bread? The words in the inſtitution, ſound alike for both: the companie to whom he miniſtred, receiued both, and were bidden to vſe both. If the cup be not neceſſarie, becauſe no lay people were among them; then by the ſame argument, neither is the bread neceſſary. I will onely vſe the teſtimonie of Cyprian, to proue that our Lord left not this mattter mutable or indifferent: he
<note n="a" place="margin">Ep. 68. edit. Morel.</note> ſayes, <hi>Know ye that we are admoniſhed, in offering the cup, to keepe the Lords tradition: that nothing be done by vs, but that which the Lord did for vs: that the cup which is offered, be offered mingled with wine.</hi> Here Gregorie
<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 1002.

This (that the reader may haue a taſte of his doings, becauſe the Reply referres me to him (is but a tricke: for he affirmes both: not onely that we muſt offer it in ſuch <hi>matter,</hi> but that we muſt <hi>offer</hi> it. For if that which Chriſt did, were the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why it ſhould be offered in ſuch a matter, then is it alſo a reaſon why it muſt be offered. And that this was Cyprians mind, appeares by
<note n="b" place="margin">Ep. 54. &amp; 63.</note> another text, where he and diuers more, to the number of fortie Biſhops, appointed the Communion
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:20570:278"/> to be giuen in both kinds to the Chriſtians in perſecution, giue this reaſon: <hi>For how do we teach or prouoke them in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his name to ſhed their bloud, if we denie them the bloud of Chriſt, when they are readie to fight? or how ſhall we make them fit for the cup of martyrdome, if we do not firſt admit them in the Church to drinke the cup of our Lord, by the right of communion?</hi> They thought the cup neceſſary for <hi>ſuch as ſhould ſhed their bloud</hi> for Chriſt, but ſuch are all men, and at all times: the cup therefore they thought neceſſary for all.

Firſt, it was not holden before Siritius time, but vnder him. Secondly, the canon alledged cannot be prooued to be a canon of the Councell, made by all the B B. but a motion or bill put vp by Aurelius, wherein he moues that <hi>they which attended on the Sacraments, be continent in all things: that ſo what the Apoſtles taught, and antiquitie held, we alſo may keepe.</hi> Thirdly, this canon was moued

All this is plaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Replie, and moſt ſenſibly demonſtrates Siritius to be the author. Fourthly, I anſwer yet cloſer to the point, that ſo much as the Biſhops conſented to, was, that Clergie men ſhould liue honeſtly and chaſtly, whether in the ſtate of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, or ſingle life; and not come at their wiues at certaine ſeaſons.

               <p n="3">3 Fourthly, touching <hi>images</hi> I ſhewed two things.

Now this is not the queſtion, but whether the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church vſed or permitted them? I ſhewed no, by the teſtimonie of a Pope and a Councell, and muſt be anſwered againe by diſproouing the authority: which if he cannot do, I will not giue much for Bellarmines prouing of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, when it appeares the Pope and a Councell 800 yeares agoe miſliked it: and himſelfe confeſſes, <hi>That it is not ſo certaine whether the images of God, or the Trinitie, may bee made, as it is that the images of Chriſt and his Saints may be made:</hi> and that

For is it therefore <hi>the doctrine of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and <hi>tradition of the Church,</hi> becauſe they ſay it? could not they that decreed idolatrie, learne of their images to tell a lie? Is there any more truth in their pretence of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie then in the image worſhip it ſelfe?

               <p n="8">8 And this example ſhewes how friuolous the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon anſwer is, that their differences are not <hi>in points of faith,</hi> but in by-matters, not determined, wherein it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to hold any part. For this difference is in a point defined, though not by any Popiſh councell, yet by the word of God: or whether it be defined or no, it is in a matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they hold againſt vs, bearing men in hand that they can ſhew catalogues and whole companies in all ages that held therein with them.

Yet the Proteſtants are not curious, and the Church of Rome gaines not a ſtraw by it. Secondly, that <hi>the ancient Fathers teſtifie he was at Rome.</hi> This I grant: but yet all the Papiſts liuing cannot reconcile their teſtimonies, nor maintaine either that he came thither in ſuch a time, or ſtayed there ſo long as is reported. The which conſideration hath mooued as learned Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as euer were any to doubt of his being there at all, if my aduerſarie thinke them ſo impudent that do it.

Whence it followes that his being there was a common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but not certaine, forſomuch as it was grounded on no ſurer teſtimonie then theſe circumſtances of <hi>Time</hi> were.

And whether the Fathers had any certainety of that they ſaid, or onely followed a common rumor, begun by ſuch a one as Papias was, without examining it; God knowes: but our Aduerſaries themſelues feele the difficulty, and cannot remoue it.

It hath not bene the leaſt part of the Church of Romes policie, for many ages together, with fained miracles, and counterfet relickes, to breed and nouriſh in the vulgar people an opinion of the Roman holineſſe. But let them, that will be led by ſuch monuments, firſt make ſure they be not counterfets.

                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 20.21.</note> by theſe words <hi>Paſce oues meas</hi>) ſignifieth an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie office, which dieth not with the perſon, but is to be continued in a ſucceſſour. Secondly, the end of this office, being common to all ages, argueth that our Sauiour meant ſo to inſtitute it, as it might ſerue for all ages: and conſequently that it ſhould be continued in a ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch <hi>Paſtours.</hi> Thirdly, the loue and care which moued our Sauiour to inſtitute this office, for the good of the Church, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Church of all ages: and the neceſſitie, which the Church had of ſuch a <hi>Paſtour,</hi> was not onely for that firſt age, but for all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages: and therefore it is not to be thought that Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour meant to inſtitute that office, onely for to continue in <hi>S.

The Paſtoral authority of Peter contained two things, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the whole latitude. Firſt, his dutie to <hi>preach</hi> the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and teach the people by miniſtring the word and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them. Secondly, his extraordinary and eminent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer thereunto, wherein he exceeded all ordinarie Paſtors, being called to be an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and inabled to plant Churches, conuert nations, reueale Chriſt, worke miracles, &amp;c. Our Aduerſaries adde a third; his <hi>ſupreme iuriſdiction</hi> ouer all the Apoſtles alſo, and all the powers on earth, ſpirituall and temporall, whereby he was the ordinary Paſtor and iudge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all the world <hi>directly,</hi> as ſome ſay, or <hi>indirectly,</hi> as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome will haue it. The firſt of theſe is called his <hi>Paſtorall office:</hi> the ſecond his <hi>Apoſtleſhip:</hi> the third his <hi>Primacy,</hi> or ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. The which diſtinction being laied; we grant that S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had abſolute Paſtoral authority, in the firſt and ſecond ſences, to preach the Goſpell, as all other Paſtors do, and beyond them all to be an Apoſtle. We grant ſecondly, that authoritie, to be an Apoſtle, and Paſtor of the Church, that he might feed the flocke of Chriſt, was either giuen or rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to him by thoſe words, <hi>feed my ſheepe.</hi> We grant third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Paſtorall authority, taken onely in the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree thereof, was not to die with him, but to remaine for euer in his ſucceſſors, the ordinary Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church. But all this will do the Pope no good; for it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preferrs him of Antioch, nor him of Rome, but makes them both equall. Fourthly, we deny any to haue ſucceeded him in his Apoſtleſhip, or God to haue ordained any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in that ſecond, and eminent degree of his Paſtoral charge: neither dare our Aduerſaries themſelues ſimply and abſolutely affirme it. The Ieſuite therefore in this his anſwer
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:20570:292"/> meanes the authoritie of Peter in the laſt ſenſe, as it imports the PRIMACY and iuriſdiction ouer the other Apoſtles, and the Kings and nations of the earth to rule and ouergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne them.

And finally, that his ſo dying there, is ſufficient (without a new reuelation from God) to make the ſucceſſion of the Biſhop of Rome of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine authoritie. When theſe things are ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, the ſucceſſion ſhall be acknowledged, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. To his confirmation, I anſwer: that, <hi>by Chriſts appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Peter was to haue his ſucceſſors:</hi> not <hi>one or other,</hi> in any ſpeciall place, but the Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church, all of them, in euery place: and not in <hi>the office of chiefe Paſtor,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the <hi>Primacie</hi> and <hi>Apoſtleſhip</hi> (for his Apoſtleſhip died with him, and Primacie, ſuch as is intended, he neuer had any) but in his Paſtorall cure of preaching &amp; miniſtring the word &amp; ſacraments, and gouerning the Church in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie with other Biſhops and Paſtors, as himſelfe did theſe things in communitie with the Apoſtles. Therefore the Biſhop of Antioch ſucceeds him in place as well as the Biſhop of Rome; but in office, all the Chriſtian Biſhops of the world ſucceed him; and in preaching and miniſtration of the ſacraments, all the inferiour Paſtors of the world. But in that which is called his ſupremacie and monarchie ouer all other Biſhops and Kings of the earth, he hath no ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, becauſe no ſuch thing was giuen him by Chriſt, but firſt was deuiſed by the Pope himſelfe for his own aduancement.</p>

But to inſiſt in one example:
<note n="h" place="margin">Chronogra. lib 4. an. ch. 901</note> Genebrard ſayes, that almoſt for the ſpace of 150 yeares, all the Popes, in number fiftie, were <hi>apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacticall and apoſtaticall rather then Apoſtolicall,</hi> by reaſon of <hi>their vnlawfull election,</hi> or violent <hi>intruſion;</hi> and entred not in by <hi>the doore,</hi> but by <hi>a backe doore:</hi> of all which, <hi>onely fiue are ſcarcely, and that very ſlenderly commended.</hi> The examples therefore are not ſo rare, as my aduerſarie would beare the world in hand, but enow, at one time, to ſhew an interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſucceſſion for at the leaſt 150 yeares together. And the manner of ſucceſsion now in our dayes, appeares to be no better, that it made the Paſquill in Rome, not long ago, ſing <hi>Re, Me, Sol, Fa:</hi> and his <hi>Nouus homo</hi> ſupplicate for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell, by reaſon there hath bin a nullitie in the ſucceſsion euer ſince Sixtus Quintus.

<pb n="551" facs="tcp:20570:297"/> againe. But he is deceiued, for he cannot ſhew that euer any ſimoniacall or violent entrance was thus confirmed: or if the Cardinals afterward allowed ſuch a one for lawfull Pope, then this makes the matter worſe, in as much as ſo vnlawfull entrance into S. Peters chaire ſhould be ratified, and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which ought to be by free and lawfull election, ſhould, in the cheefeſt Sea, be continued by violence and villanie.

If the Reply will imagine that as the Pope made this law himſelfe, ſo he may repeale it againe; I anſwer, firſt if he do, it is nothing; becauſe it is the naturall and morall law of God, indiſpenſable, that violence and corruption ſhall bring none to the altar. Secondly, <hi>de facto</hi> it hath not hitherto bene repealed, nor

Thirdly, the Pope thus entring cannot repeale them, becauſe by them he is no Pope, and none can abrogate a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer decree but he that is a lawfull Pope. If therefore the Popes owne law, or the originall conſtitution of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church, forbidding ſimoniacall, hereticall, and violent entrances, be of any force to giue being, or not being, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, or not ſucceſſion, thereunto; it is more then mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that by Simonie and violent intruſions the outward ſucceſſion of the Biſhops of Rome hath notoriouſly bene interrupted and ouerthrowne.

There are aſſigned not ſo few as 30 ſeuerall times wherein there haue bene either foure, or three, or two Popes at once: of which ſchiſmes ſome haue continued a long ſpace together, with the greateſt violence and outrage of one Pope againſt another that can be ſaid: no man liuing being able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne which was the true ſucceſſor; whereby vnanſwerably it followes, that there was no viſible head of the Church, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly knowne, all that time: but, according to our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries owne principles, the Church wanted meanes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and confirme her people in the faith: yea the liuing rule of faith ceaſed and was ouerthrowne in theſe ſchiſmes.

Now it is a rule among our

<pb n="555" facs="tcp:20570:299"/> that <hi>a doubtfull Pope is to be accounted for no Pope.</hi> The ſucceſsion therefore failed all the time of theſe ſchiſmes. And albeit, as the Reply ſpeaketh, there was <hi>meanes, by a Councell to elect a new Pope:</hi> yet what ſucceſſe theſe <hi>meanes</hi> had, he may perceiue by the ſtories of the Councels of Piſa. Conſtance and Baſil: whereof this laſt
<note n="d" place="margin">Aen. Sylu. comment. de Geſt. Baſil.

And beſides, though a Councell may depoſe the ſchiſmatickes, and elect a new Pope, yet who ſhall he that is thus elected ſucceed? or how can a Councell, or any other meanes that ſhall be vſed, peece together the interruption paſt, that it may truly be ſaid, the ſucceſsion was neuer broken? Martin was elected by the Councell of Conſtance, but let the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, and Gregory of Valence his maſter, of whom he hath borrowed all that he ſayes, anſwer whom he ſucceeded? whether Vrban and his ſucceſſors, or Clement and his: which ſide ſoeuer he takes, he cannot rid himſelfe. For Clement, and they that followed him in his time, are thruſt out of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue, and Vrbane, with thoſe that followed him, put in: yet the ſaid Vrban, in his time, was thought no right Pope; and Eugenius that immediatly followed this Martin, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Councell of Baſil.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 The Ieſuites <hi>hope</hi> therefore, that he hath anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the obiections, will faile him: things may wittily and cunningly be pretended, but let euery man that will ſtabliſh his conſcience in the truth, enquire whether the reaſon of true ſucceſsion can hold where ſuch things as theſe fall out: and whether it be poſsible, or can ſtand with Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that a ſucceſsion, planted for ſuch purpoſes as our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries pretend this of Rome to be, ſhall be furniſhed and peeced out with boyes, women, hereticks, ignorant and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettered dotards, ſimoniacall intruders, and ſo many times diuers of them at once? Two things therefore touching this matter of ſucceſsion are the truth. Firſt that the outward
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:20570:300"/> and perſonall ſucceſsion of Biſhops, in the Church of Rome, is not ſo entire as is pretended: but hath bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed and poiſoned with ſo many diſorders, that it is as lame a ſucceſsion as any is whereſoeuer in the world. Their catalogues aſsigned, and drawne to exhibite to the vulgar people, looke ſmooth on the outſide, and nothing but well is diſcerned in them; but examine the particulars, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the hiſtories of their ſucceſsion, and there was neuer any thing ſo patched and peeced together as they. Secondly, the ſucceſsion of doctrine is the true ſucceſsion, and is not tied to that which is in place and perſons: and therefore let not the Ieſuites blaze out their catalogues of names, vntill they can prooue the corruptions which they haue added to religion (wherein onely we forſake the Church of Rome) were holden and beleeued by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons named. For what foolery is it to make a catalogue of Ieſus Chriſt, Saint Peter, all the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts, the virgin Marie, and the whole Church of the firſt ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares, as if theſe had profeſſed what the Pope and his rabble now teach: did theſe <hi>adore images?</hi> vſe the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in one kind?</hi> beleeue <hi>Purgatorie?</hi> did theſe teach it lawfull for the Pope to <hi>excommunicate, depoſe, murder the Kings</hi> of the earth? Are not all theſe things againſt their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe doctrine? Let our aduerſaries retire backe to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and truth, and giue ouer their courſes. There are two parts of their religion. One wherein they and we agree, as that there is <hi>one God, three perſons, one redeemer Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> that <hi>the Scripture Canonicall is Gods word:</hi> that the <hi>dead ſhall riſe:</hi> and all the reſt wherein we conſent. Another part of their religion is it which we and all the reformed Churches haue caſt off: as <hi>Images, Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatorie, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi> and a hundred ſuch like points. The Catalogue aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſufficiently ſhewes the former part, both for them and vs, againſt all Iewes and Gentiles that denie it. The latter part they cannot ſhew to haue bene holden by the perſons named, vntill many ages after Chriſt, as they came in by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: in all which time the truth maintained by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:20570:300"/> againſt them was holden ſtill; and the Papacie was but a faction in the Church, oppoſing the ſounder part thereof. And ſo the viſible Church of Rome it ſelfe is it wherein the Proteſtants faith, in all ages, hath bene profeſſed, for the ſubſtance thereof.</p>
